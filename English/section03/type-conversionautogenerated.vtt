Welcome back.

00:01.520 --> 00:10.280
Remember in Python that string is written as SDR and this is a special word.

00:10.310 --> 00:14.930
Actually it's a built in what we call a function or a built in action that we can take.

00:14.960 --> 00:26.450
Now let me ask you this what happens if I do string 100 one hundred is clearly a number an integer but

00:26.780 --> 00:36.860
what if we run the string function on this let's find out let's do print here and then run this.

00:36.860 --> 00:41.870
If I click Run I get a hundred.

00:41.930 --> 00:43.230
All right.

00:43.310 --> 00:51.800
But is this an int or a string to find that out.

00:51.860 --> 00:54.970
Once again let's wrap this.

00:55.190 --> 01:04.760
So the answer of whatever this value is into type.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.760
I know this is a lot of brackets but remember we're evaluating this piece of code.

01:11.120 --> 01:16.820
So we're turning 100 into a string or running the string action and then we're going to check the type

01:16.940 --> 01:19.850
of this entire thing and then we're going to print it out.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.130
If I click Run I see that it's a String type.

01:25.130 --> 01:29.580
So we've converted one hundred into string using this.

01:29.780 --> 01:34.430
Now just to confuse you a little bit more what if we do something like

01:38.630 --> 01:40.800
like this all right.

01:40.830 --> 01:41.850
Even more brackets.

01:41.850 --> 01:42.800
What happens now.

01:42.840 --> 01:52.390
Can you guess while we convert a hundred into a string then convert it back into an integer and then

01:52.390 --> 01:54.660
we check the type of it which is a class INT.

01:54.670 --> 01:55.630
And then we print that.

01:56.380 --> 02:07.420
So remember this was the same as me saying A equals SDR one hundred and then B is going to equal int

02:09.570 --> 02:19.230
of A because we're evaluating this part and then I'm saying C is going to equal the type of whatever

02:19.800 --> 02:21.580
B is.

02:21.670 --> 02:31.890
And then finally we're printing C so that piece of code was the same as doing this very very cool.

02:31.890 --> 02:37.300
Now this is the idea of type conversion again.

02:37.310 --> 02:41.630
If I were to write that down it's called type conversion.

02:41.690 --> 02:49.100
We're converting the type of our data types and you can do that throughout programming and we'll talk

02:49.490 --> 02:52.130
a lot about this throughout the course.

02:52.130 --> 02:59.210
But it's the main reason we have things like SDR int we have things like float and many other data types

02:59.210 --> 03:00.700
that we're going to talk about.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.800
I'll see in the next video by.
