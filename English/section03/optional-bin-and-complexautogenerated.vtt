00:00.450 --> 00:01.400
Welcome back.

00:01.410 --> 00:07.130
This is a quick optional video that well with something that you probably won't use.

00:07.140 --> 00:13.050
But I want you to just know that it's out there and that is there's actually an extra data type that

00:13.080 --> 00:13.970
I did and talk about.

00:14.340 --> 00:16.080
And it's called complex.

00:16.260 --> 00:20.750
And as the name suggests it's pretty complex.

00:20.910 --> 00:32.150
However a complex number again is a number that is a third type instead of int and float.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.830
We also have this type four numbers.

00:34.830 --> 00:41.340
Now the reason I'm not really teaching complex is that you only use this if you're doing something really

00:41.340 --> 00:42.960
really complex math.

00:43.020 --> 00:45.150
Most of the time you'll never use it.

00:45.150 --> 00:50.760
I personally have never used it but it is good to know that it exists.

00:50.760 --> 00:56.240
It's the equivalent to a real number and you can read about complex numbers if you want.

00:56.460 --> 00:59.370
But again that's something that you don't need to worry.

00:59.370 --> 01:02.110
Ninety nine point nine percent of the time.

01:02.130 --> 01:08.760
Another thing I want to talk to you about is this idea that these integers and floats get stored such

01:08.760 --> 01:17.340
as five in memory as binary that is as binary numbers ones and zeros and there's actually an action

01:17.400 --> 01:24.480
or function that we can use in Python called Ben for binary and you can see that a bean returns the

01:24.480 --> 01:27.360
binary representation of an integer.

01:27.360 --> 01:35.830
So it's going to return whatever the binary version of 5 is if I click Run here while I have to print

01:36.130 --> 01:36.910
remember.

01:37.030 --> 01:45.590
So let's print and click Run and I get the binary representation.

01:45.930 --> 01:52.440
Now instead of all zeros and ones there's also this idea of B and that is what Python uses underneath

01:52.440 --> 01:58.650
the hood to say a when I see this number with zero B that's a binary number.

01:58.650 --> 02:11.590
But if I Google binary number five I see that the binary number for 5 is 1 0 1 which again that's what

02:11.590 --> 02:15.640
we see here so that's really cool.

02:15.650 --> 02:18.850
Really interesting just to know that it exists by the way.

02:18.890 --> 02:25.220
Just for fun let's say that we want to return this into a decimal let's say where the computer and we

02:25.220 --> 02:35.810
just retrieve this binary number I can do it and then wrap this like this in single or double quotes

02:36.900 --> 02:45.630
and then with the end I can also say hey I want this return to a number that is base 10 which is what

02:45.840 --> 02:47.740
us humans use.

02:47.760 --> 02:58.910
So if I actually do print here and click Run well actually we have to do base to here.

02:58.910 --> 03:07.430
Right because what we're saying is hey this number is base 2 and convert it to integer and base to number

03:07.430 --> 03:10.250
is while zeros and 1 it's a binary number.

03:10.280 --> 03:14.910
So if I click right here look at that I get five.

03:15.780 --> 03:22.380
So in your head you can think of it this way when we story number like five an integer like five when

03:22.380 --> 03:24.030
a computer retrieves that number.

03:24.060 --> 03:25.670
Let's say we're do some addition.

03:25.860 --> 03:29.590
Well it's going to grab this for memory.

03:29.640 --> 03:35.040
It's going to say well this is a binary number and I'm going to convert it into integer.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.500
Very very cool.

03:36.510 --> 03:43.350
Now the reason I taught this here you won't see this a lot in beginner courses and especially so early

03:43.350 --> 03:44.000
in the course.

03:44.010 --> 03:48.630
But I think it's an important principle although you might not get tested on this ever.

03:48.810 --> 03:54.210
For you to just understand how things are working underneath the hood I believe is an important thing

03:54.210 --> 03:57.030
for you to do in order to become a great developer.

03:57.270 --> 04:00.200
So hopefully this doesn't confuse you too much.

04:00.210 --> 04:01.860
I'll see you in the next video by.
