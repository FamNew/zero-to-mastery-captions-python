00:00.580 --> 00:02.290
All right all right all right.

00:02.290 --> 00:08.920
So up until now we've spent for ever talking about numbers and strings and you're thinking oh God we

00:08.920 --> 00:12.040
have so many more to go through and my head hurts already.

00:12.040 --> 00:16.780
Well you know what I think you're going to really really like this one because this one's really really

00:16.780 --> 00:25.990
short and they're called billions and billions in Python is bull and bull.

00:26.280 --> 00:29.240
Well there's only two options.

00:29.450 --> 00:34.990
A bull can either be true or false.

00:35.150 --> 00:35.600
That's it.

00:36.140 --> 00:37.160
How awesome is that.

00:37.190 --> 00:44.820
You just learned billions so a billion I can assign to let's say my Facebook profile.

00:45.080 --> 00:56.800
I can say Andre or I can say name equals Andre and make sure that we form this into a string and then

00:56.860 --> 01:03.670
I can say bull let's say we're creating an even better social network than Facebook or creating our

01:03.670 --> 01:03.820
own.

01:04.270 --> 01:13.490
And this social network also has the is cool option on your user profile and let's say for now it's

01:13.610 --> 01:14.190
false.

01:14.320 --> 01:21.920
You see over here that's being highlighted now is cool is set to false but all of a sudden I'm thinking

01:22.250 --> 01:27.090
my profile doesn't look good if is cool is set to fall so I'm going to change that.

01:27.110 --> 01:30.930
I'm going to say is cool is now equal to true.

01:30.980 --> 01:35.980
Now my profile has been changed to is cool is true.

01:36.020 --> 01:38.760
Hurray and that's it.

01:39.980 --> 01:50.070
Billions represent this idea of true and false which in programming is kind of like saying 0 and 1 their

01:50.190 --> 01:52.150
logical values.

01:52.290 --> 01:52.830
Right.

01:52.850 --> 01:59.040
There is some logic that we can use and we'll see you when we talk about conditionals in upcoming videos

01:59.310 --> 02:06.450
where billions become really really useful because we can use billions to control the flow of our program

02:06.690 --> 02:07.870
to do something.

02:07.980 --> 02:16.680
If something is true to do another thing if something is false it's a cornerstone of computer science.

02:16.680 --> 02:24.450
And by the way a topic we're going to explore more and more is this idea of using billions to denote

02:24.720 --> 02:25.240
logic.

02:25.650 --> 02:34.380
So for example what do you think a bowl of one converting one two billion would do if I print this and

02:34.380 --> 02:47.500
I click Run I get true in boolean one means true a zero while that equals false and remember we're just

02:47.500 --> 02:54.940
simply converting this integer into a bowling value and a boolean well just either false or true nothing

02:54.940 --> 02:55.300
else.

02:55.330 --> 02:56.510
That's it.

02:56.510 --> 03:03.320
And I can also convert a string that says true into a bully and true.

03:03.320 --> 03:07.900
Again this is something we're going to explore a little bit more when we talk about conditional logic.

03:08.200 --> 03:14.630
But I wanted to make this video nice and short to let you know that hey not all these data types are

03:14.630 --> 03:17.900
as complex as well numbers and strings.

03:17.900 --> 03:18.440
All right.

03:18.440 --> 03:19.290
Nice and short.

03:19.310 --> 03:20.790
I'll see in the next one.

03:20.840 --> 03:21.110
Bye bye.
