00:00.420 --> 00:01.650
Welcome back.

00:01.680 --> 00:07.330
Now if you remember let's have something different here so we have unique keys.

00:07.380 --> 00:09.880
If you remember we have to have a unique keys.

00:09.900 --> 00:18.360
So let's say this is great and this is a I don't know let's say a basket and we can access basket like

00:18.360 --> 00:22.700
this if I click Run get one two three.

00:22.770 --> 00:25.830
But what if we don't know what this dictionary is.

00:25.830 --> 00:32.640
Maybe a dictionary is something well somewhere else where we can't see but we want to know if this let's

00:32.640 --> 00:34.470
call this user.

00:34.470 --> 00:45.140
If this user has maybe property like H So do they have this H key.

00:45.320 --> 00:46.490
Well if I click Run

00:49.360 --> 00:51.160
I get an error key error.

00:51.160 --> 00:58.990
H H doesn't exist but remember errors in our programs and this is something we'll cover later on are

00:59.080 --> 00:59.930
not good.

00:59.990 --> 01:05.490
They're going to stop the program as soon as the python interpreters enters an error.

01:05.560 --> 01:11.200
It's going to kick out of the program and say hey you have an error and it's going to completely ignore

01:11.200 --> 01:16.540
what's underneath it here we don't have anything but in a real life program we want to avoid these errors

01:16.570 --> 01:18.780
because it stops execution.

01:18.820 --> 01:26.520
So another good way to access a key and to see if it even exists is to use dot get and guess what does

01:26.560 --> 01:29.910
get is did you guess a method.

01:29.910 --> 01:31.320
Well there you go.

01:31.350 --> 01:39.160
Dog get is a method on the object or the dictionary in Python.

01:39.270 --> 01:50.020
So here if we do get age and do run I get none.

01:50.090 --> 01:51.720
So my program doesn't error.

01:51.740 --> 01:54.200
It just says hey there is nothing there.

01:54.260 --> 01:55.490
It's an absence of value.

01:55.610 --> 01:57.970
And we've learned what none means by now.

01:58.040 --> 02:02.330
So that's a really nice way to avoid those errors by the way.

02:02.330 --> 02:06.920
If let's say there's no age in the user but you want to have a default value.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.290
You can do something like this.

02:08.390 --> 02:16.510
So you add a comma and then here you say whatever you want as the default value so let's forget that.

02:16.790 --> 02:20.990
If I click Run I get 55.

02:21.610 --> 02:29.440
Because now I'm saying Hey grab the h from the user dictionary if age doesn't exist on the user dictionary

02:29.710 --> 02:31.120
use 55.

02:31.150 --> 02:42.550
So now we have 55 but if the user already has age and I click Run I get 20.

02:42.600 --> 02:50.190
So this is Hey in case age doesn't exist at a default value that's really really nice.

02:50.190 --> 02:55.140
Now I'm going to show you another way to create a dictionary which is not very common in most of the

02:55.140 --> 02:59.550
time you want to use this syntax but just so you're aware of it.

02:59.670 --> 03:01.050
Here's another way.

03:01.050 --> 03:05.870
Let's say we have a new user so User 2.

03:06.480 --> 03:13.890
I can create here a dictionary by saying dict which again is a built in function.

03:13.890 --> 03:15.750
And in here look at that.

03:15.750 --> 03:20.640
It shows me Hey this is going to create a new empty dictionary and we can create different values key

03:20.640 --> 03:29.970
variable value pairs and we simply say I want the key to equal the value.

03:29.970 --> 03:35.740
So in my case let's just say that I want the name to equal

03:39.000 --> 03:49.180
if I now print out user to well before I click Run I see that I have a red underline and by the way

03:49.210 --> 03:50.800
if you see here pi flakes.

03:50.920 --> 03:55.840
That's something called linking something we'll talk about when we talk about developer environments.

03:55.840 --> 04:01.090
We're using this Lintner that tells you whenever you make errors in Python and it says keywords can

04:01.090 --> 04:10.450
be an expression that just means that hey the keyword needs to be well just a variable that we create.

04:10.460 --> 04:21.310
So if I click Run here look at that I have name John John so we've create a user with this key value

04:21.550 --> 04:22.480
pair.

04:22.720 --> 04:27.430
Now like I said this way of creating dictionaries is not very common.

04:27.430 --> 04:32.380
Most of the time you'll do something like this but at least now you know that this is why this built

04:32.380 --> 04:36.250
in function exists I'll see in the next one.

04:36.510 --> 04:36.740
By.
