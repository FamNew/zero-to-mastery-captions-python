Let's talk about another developer fundamental and this one is commenting your code.

00:08.390 --> 00:15.680
Up until now you may have seen me comment at comments to our script's for example right here.

00:15.680 --> 00:23.200
I added a comment of billions and this tells the Python interpreter hey this is a comment.

00:23.210 --> 00:25.790
Don't run this it's just for me.

00:25.790 --> 00:32.150
You can just ignore it and skip over to line two and you saw that I simply did that in Python with the

00:32.270 --> 00:33.030
punchline.

00:33.140 --> 00:38.920
As soon as Python sees a pound sign it adds a comment and you can do that after a line as well.

00:38.990 --> 00:50.360
I can say this assigns to a variable and although this may look like two lines it's actually just the

00:50.480 --> 00:56.790
word wrapping that's happening and you can see that the interpreter just completely ignores these comments.

00:57.080 --> 01:02.080
Now commenting sounds very very simple but it's an important concept.

01:02.090 --> 01:07.790
And if you want to be a good programmer in all languages we have commenting.

01:08.030 --> 01:14.500
But there's good ways and bad ways of commenting and this is something that comes with practice.

01:14.510 --> 01:21.430
But here are some key guidelines when you're commenting your code.

01:21.470 --> 01:26.150
The idea is that you're adding valuable comments.

01:26.150 --> 01:40.310
That is if I add a comment here that says hey this is a sign the name variable a value of Andre string

01:41.750 --> 01:45.510
a comment like this is not really good.

01:45.560 --> 01:46.880
Why is that.

01:46.880 --> 01:51.990
Well because your code should be self explanatory.

01:52.040 --> 01:52.600
Right.

01:52.610 --> 01:58.160
The idea is for us to write code that is easy to read easy to understand.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.260
It's not trying to be clever.

02:00.260 --> 02:07.340
Instead it should read like English and any python programmer would know that here we're just simply

02:07.340 --> 02:10.280
adding Andre as a value of name.

02:10.310 --> 02:13.770
We're assigning a variable and adding a comment like this.

02:13.790 --> 02:20.990
That's self-explanatory just adds clutter to your code so there's a tradeoff here.

02:20.990 --> 02:26.390
It's good to comment your code for let's say you if you're working on teams and other developers come

02:26.660 --> 02:33.650
and they want to understand your code but you have to remember this principle of code being easy to

02:33.650 --> 02:35.190
read.

02:35.210 --> 02:43.580
The only time you want to add comments to your code is well when something really really important is

02:43.580 --> 02:51.680
happening where it might be a little complex you first decide hey is this code written in a way that

02:51.950 --> 02:52.860
makes sense.

02:52.880 --> 03:03.490
For example if this was variable a and this was variable B well this might be really hard for somebody

03:03.490 --> 03:04.170
to understand.

03:04.180 --> 03:07.740
So you might say that this is is cool.

03:07.780 --> 03:15.790
Flag but before you add that comment you want to say to yourself maybe my code is hard to read.

03:15.860 --> 03:22.290
Maybe I should just change the variable to is cool to make it more understandable.

03:22.310 --> 03:29.780
Now this is something that you improve upon more and more and you do want to use comments as an extra

03:29.780 --> 03:31.800
tool to make your code understandable.

03:31.910 --> 03:36.820
Maybe you write code that six months from now you want to go back to understand what you did.

03:37.220 --> 03:42.410
But remember more comments doesn't necessarily mean better code.

03:42.410 --> 03:51.020
You want to be concise and keeping things simple while adding comments only when necessary to help others

03:51.050 --> 03:56.840
understand your code not trying to make your unreadable code more readable.

03:56.840 --> 04:01.400
We'll explore this topic and give you advice on it throughout the course.

04:01.400 --> 04:08.590
But remember this key developer fundamental because you're going to need it throughout your career.

04:08.630 --> 04:17.720
By the way this article over here has some really important points that I think you'll really benefit

04:17.720 --> 04:21.830
from especially in the commenting best practices.

04:21.830 --> 04:28.160
You can read some of the dos and don'ts and what some of the top programmers do when commenting.

04:28.250 --> 04:33.610
I know it sounds silly but it is an important concept that most courses overlook.

04:33.710 --> 04:36.780
So I highly recommend you read over this.

04:36.890 --> 04:41.110
I'll link to it in the resources and I'll see you in the next video.
