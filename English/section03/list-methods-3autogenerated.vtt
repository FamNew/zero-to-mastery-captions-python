00:00.780 --> 00:01.110
All right.

00:01.110 --> 00:02.940
It feels like it's never going to end.

00:02.940 --> 00:09.420
We have so many methods with less but like I said lists have a lot of methods because you can do a lot

00:09.420 --> 00:09.990
with them.

00:10.020 --> 00:13.830
It seems like a lot right now but trust me these are going to become second nature.

00:13.830 --> 00:15.050
So hang in there.

00:15.090 --> 00:24.460
I have a few more to show you the next one is called sort guess what sort is going to do if I click

00:24.610 --> 00:29.570
Run I get none.

00:29.880 --> 00:37.650
But remember sort sorts the list as you can imagine in place that means and modifies the list.

00:37.650 --> 00:48.470
So if I remove this up to here and then do a sort or do basket and I click Run look at that I get a

00:48.470 --> 00:52.750
sorted list where a D was moved in front of me.

00:53.240 --> 01:02.970
If I add let's say x at the beginning here and I click run it's going to move the X all the way to the

01:02.970 --> 01:03.170
end.

01:03.390 --> 01:10.530
It's going to sort the list in place for me again if I hover over it sees that it's going to not return

01:10.530 --> 01:17.130
anything which is why our print initially didn't work we had to print our basket not whatever this produces

01:17.160 --> 01:19.960
which doesn't produce anything.

01:20.400 --> 01:28.280
But what about this one if we go to built in functions I have something called sorted and if I do sorted

01:28.380 --> 01:35.940
and because it's a function not a method I can do sorted dot or basket.

01:35.940 --> 01:42.220
So around the brackets is just like print if I run this.

01:42.450 --> 01:42.820
All right.

01:42.820 --> 01:55.110
Nothing has changed but what if I remove this and put it in here if I click Run I get a b c d d e x.

01:55.680 --> 02:01.910
What if I comment this out so that we're not sorting it anymore we just have the basket and then we

02:01.910 --> 02:04.590
run this sorted function.

02:04.700 --> 02:10.730
If I run did you see that sorted.

02:10.730 --> 02:20.890
I know it's confusing why do they even have to but sorted produces a new array so if I do print basket

02:20.890 --> 02:32.780
here and I click Run the basket hasn't been modified the basket still remains the same.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.850
It's this one over here that's not sorted sorted.

02:35.980 --> 02:39.880
On the other hand doesn't modify the basket in place.

02:39.880 --> 02:44.590
Instead it creates a new copy of the basket and sorts it.

02:44.590 --> 02:47.110
It's almost as if we're doing this.

02:47.110 --> 02:54.940
We're saying new basket equals basket and then we're going to copy that basket.

02:54.940 --> 03:04.630
Remember list slicing and then we're performing new basket dot sort on this new list so that if I do

03:05.660 --> 03:16.790
new basket and I click Run we get the same thing so you have to be careful of certain actions that perform

03:16.790 --> 03:22.720
an action in place or create a completely new list to begin with.

03:22.750 --> 03:31.670
By the way there's also instead of this a dot copy method that we can use and if I run this again we

03:31.670 --> 03:40.160
get the same thing copy just as the name suggests copy the list for us and returns for us a new list.

03:40.180 --> 03:40.770
All right.

03:40.770 --> 03:48.580
One last one and that is basket dot reverse.

03:48.670 --> 03:49.630
What do you think this does.

03:49.630 --> 04:00.290
Based on the name well if I check out the basket here and click Run is that what you expected.

04:01.830 --> 04:12.740
It reverses the basket in place but notice that it's not like sort it's not sorting it's simply switching

04:12.800 --> 04:15.910
all the indexes into opposite sides.

04:16.280 --> 04:22.380
So D is now index of 0 E is now index of one index of 2 3.

04:22.380 --> 04:23.660
So on and so forth.

04:23.780 --> 04:27.090
So you can see here that it doesn't actually sort it.

04:27.150 --> 04:38.360
Instead while we might want to do is sort first then reverse and if we click Run we have a sorted reversed

04:38.990 --> 04:40.350
basket.

04:40.420 --> 04:44.580
This is a little tricky one that some interviewers might ask.

04:44.590 --> 04:45.130
All right.

04:45.130 --> 04:46.790
Good job getting this far.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.340
We're almost done with lists.

04:49.340 --> 04:51.290
So I'll see you in the next video by.
