00:00.850 --> 00:01.890
Welcome back.

00:01.900 --> 00:05.970
Let's talk about our next data type and it's a big one.

00:06.070 --> 00:09.830
A very very useful one.

00:09.840 --> 00:18.290
It's called list and list is an ordered sequence of objects that can be of any type.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.820
So you can think of them as strings right.

00:22.830 --> 00:30.750
We had strings previously that we learned about except that each sequence of this string well was was

00:30.750 --> 00:36.310
a string was a letter or a number wrapped in quotation marks lists.

00:36.320 --> 00:39.410
On the other hand looks something like this.

00:39.620 --> 00:47.810
Let's say we create a variable ally and list we denote with square brackets and inside of these square

00:47.810 --> 00:50.660
brackets we can have different objects.

00:50.660 --> 00:55.300
So for example we can have one two three four five.

00:55.340 --> 01:07.820
We can also have let's say ally 2 AND THIS IS GOING TO HAVE A B C and it can have any collection of

01:07.820 --> 01:17.690
items that we want we can even mix and match and say that we have one two then a then maybe even the

01:17.690 --> 01:30.370
Boolean value true so all of these are lists now lists are extremely important and in other programming

01:30.370 --> 01:35.010
languages you might have heard the word arrays.

01:35.170 --> 01:43.440
So in Python lists are a form of array and later on when we get into the modules section of the course

01:43.740 --> 01:50.220
we will talk about the difference between lists and arrays but if you are coming from a different programming

01:50.220 --> 01:59.760
background then lists are like arrays in your language a collection of items Now the neat thing about

01:59.760 --> 02:04.880
lists is that it's the first data structure that we're learning now.

02:04.950 --> 02:08.430
What is a data structure.

02:08.430 --> 02:12.720
Data structure is a very important concept in programming languages.

02:12.720 --> 02:22.590
It's a way for us to organize information and data into let's say a folder or a cupboard or a box so

02:22.590 --> 02:27.240
that these data structures can be used with different pros and cons.

02:27.240 --> 02:34.200
For example you have a fridge where you store your food and fridges are really really good at putting

02:34.380 --> 02:41.010
your food inside keeping it cold and then taking it out or you might have a backpack a backpack is really

02:41.010 --> 02:45.870
really good to stuff everything in there but when you're looking for things in a backpack it's really

02:45.870 --> 02:46.520
really hard.

02:46.890 --> 02:54.090
So you can think of data structures similar to that a container around your data that has different

02:54.090 --> 02:56.470
pros and cons of accessing that data.

02:56.490 --> 03:02.230
Removing that data writing data but that's something we'll get into a little bit later.

03:02.250 --> 03:10.920
The key here is that the square brackets allow us to contain information and data like strings integers

03:11.160 --> 03:15.730
floats if we want to bullying us into a contained fashion.

03:15.870 --> 03:17.850
So let's think of a good example here.

03:17.880 --> 03:25.950
What if we had a shopping cart let's say where Amazon here and then Amazon has the Amazon shopping cart

03:26.600 --> 03:29.590
and then here we can collect different things that we want.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.710
Maybe we collect some.

03:31.710 --> 03:34.470
I don't know notebooks and you know what.

03:34.530 --> 03:39.380
Let's get some gadgets let's get some maybe some sunglasses.

03:39.600 --> 03:47.990
We can add different items here different strings different data into this cart and now just like we

03:47.990 --> 03:53.750
saw in strings we can access the Amazon cart in different ways.

03:53.770 --> 04:02.230
For example I can access it again with square brackets and simply say I want to item zero so fine print

04:02.230 --> 04:07.760
here and do Amazon cart look at that.

04:07.800 --> 04:08.910
I get notebooks.

04:08.910 --> 04:14.520
The second item I get sunglasses.

04:14.580 --> 04:16.140
What about the third item

04:18.990 --> 04:20.370
no list.

04:20.430 --> 04:25.070
Index out of range but this should make sense now.

04:25.100 --> 04:31.150
This is a list where we're accessing the index of but it only contains two items.

04:31.150 --> 04:35.790
So if we're going 0 1 to the third item nothing exists.

04:35.800 --> 04:39.000
So our program says if that doesn't work you're doing something wrong.

04:40.300 --> 04:47.530
And just like strings these list items are in memory in their separate bookshelf.

04:47.530 --> 04:49.500
Right but one right next to each other.

04:49.510 --> 04:52.960
So we can go 0 1 2 3 4 5.

04:52.990 --> 04:56.210
So on and so forth until the list ends.

04:56.410 --> 04:56.870
All right.

04:56.920 --> 05:00.810
Let's learn about lists a lot more in the next video by.
