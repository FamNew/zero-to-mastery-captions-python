Welcome back.

00:01.700 --> 00:12.950
I want to talk to you quickly about something called Matrix and a matrix is a way to describe 2D lists

00:13.190 --> 00:15.550
or multidimensional lists.

00:15.560 --> 00:16.730
What do I mean.

00:16.730 --> 00:25.010
Well I can create a matrix and this is a name that I just made so I can call it whatever I want but

00:25.010 --> 00:29.760
usually these are called Matrix in programming and it looks something like this.

00:29.780 --> 00:36.240
It's an array with another array inside of it so let's say for example

00:39.510 --> 00:52.700
I have one two three here and then another array one or listed two for six and then another array seven

00:53.030 --> 00:57.030
eight nine what's happening here.

00:57.040 --> 00:59.660
Well it's a two dimensional array.

00:59.770 --> 01:08.060
We have the main array and then we have sub arrays three arrays to be exact.

01:08.070 --> 01:10.590
Now why is this useful.

01:10.590 --> 01:15.330
And by the way this is two dimensional but we can have multiple ones.

01:15.360 --> 01:25.220
For example you can have another array inside of this array but why is this important these type of

01:25.220 --> 01:33.560
matrices come up a lot in topics like machine learning or image processing for example a computer doesn't

01:33.560 --> 01:36.820
really know what a photo of a dog is.

01:37.040 --> 01:40.210
The only thing it understands is zeros and ones.

01:40.250 --> 01:48.860
So a lot of photos for example let's say we had a very simple photograph of a giant X maybe this letter

01:48.890 --> 01:54.420
X well a computer can understand an image based on pixels on the screen.

01:54.530 --> 02:09.770
So maybe we can have 0 1 0 1 0 0 or sorry 1 here 0 here and then 1.

02:09.820 --> 02:16.870
And right now a computer can look at this and if this represented let's say a tiny little pixel here

02:17.170 --> 02:22.690
or maybe a pixel here or my screen the computer's going to say oh there's a one here.

02:22.690 --> 02:31.030
So that means I should make this green in this corner then dark here then green then dark green dark

02:31.330 --> 02:40.240
green dark green and a computer is able to draw let's say an X and this is a simple example and using

02:40.450 --> 02:46.240
matrices we can do a lot of these heavy calculations and that's how computers work underneath the hood

02:46.240 --> 02:51.910
when let's say for example it's trying to display something but the reason I wanted to talk about this

02:51.910 --> 03:01.390
here is when you want to access a multi dimensional list well you would do something like this let's

03:01.390 --> 03:13.650
say matrix access the first item in the matrix which in this case will be this first array because it's

03:13.650 --> 03:19.420
the first item and then let's say we want to access the zero in here or else change us to five.

03:20.070 --> 03:24.380
Well I'll do square brackets again and just do 0 1.

03:24.390 --> 03:28.540
So if I go one here and let's print that out

03:33.700 --> 03:37.860
and I click Run I get five.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.420
So it's accessing the first item in the array.

03:40.460 --> 03:46.790
So it's going to look at the first order array grab the first item which is right here and then grab

03:46.790 --> 03:49.250
the second item in that array.

03:49.310 --> 03:57.480
So 0 1 which is 5 and you can keep doing this if he had multi-dimensional arrays you can keep adding

03:57.480 --> 04:04.720
keep adding keep adding to access that information from an array or list.

04:04.720 --> 04:10.130
But remember in Python we want to use the term list I'll see in the next one.

04:10.310 --> 04:10.540
Bobby.
