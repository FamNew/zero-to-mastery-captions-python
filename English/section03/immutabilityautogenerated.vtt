00:01.240 --> 00:09.400
So up until now we learned that strings can be accessed quite easily and using the square brackets we

00:09.400 --> 00:12.310
can access different parts of the string.

00:12.370 --> 00:22.600
And this idea of a start a stop and a step over is what we call slicing or String slicing because we

00:22.600 --> 00:24.270
can slice the string.

00:24.280 --> 00:31.090
However we like but we also need to learn another important term that's going to come up again and again

00:31.090 --> 00:32.260
throughout this course.

00:32.260 --> 00:37.450
And as a matter of fact it's an important concept that as you get more advanced into programming you

00:37.450 --> 00:40.930
really need to understand what is this concept.

00:41.350 --> 00:44.630
Well it's this idea of immutability.

00:44.740 --> 00:48.550
It's an important term in programming.

00:48.650 --> 00:55.420
What does immutability mean well strings in Python are immutable.

00:55.540 --> 00:58.030
That means they cannot be changed.

00:58.360 --> 01:06.560
What I mean by that now that we've assigned selfish this value this string.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.480
Well I can reassign it right.

01:09.480 --> 01:21.870
I can say selfish is a hundred now and if I print selfish and I click Run that works but if I instead

01:22.140 --> 01:33.560
do something like the first index of selfish is going to equal 8 and I click Run I get an error I get

01:33.560 --> 01:39.980
a type error saying String object does not support item assignment why is that.

01:39.980 --> 01:43.250
Because strings are immutable.

01:43.380 --> 01:47.650
That is I cannot change the value of this.

01:47.680 --> 01:52.440
Once it's created I can't just immediately change it to eight.

01:52.450 --> 01:54.030
One two three four five six seven.

01:54.060 --> 01:54.320
No.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.540
It has to stay the same.

01:56.560 --> 02:06.310
The only way that I can remove this or change this is to completely reassign the value so that in memory

02:07.060 --> 02:15.070
Python removes all of this from our bookshelf of memory and instead just assigns eight into the zero

02:15.070 --> 02:19.900
bookshelf and removes everything else because we don't use it anymore.

02:19.930 --> 02:27.130
Now this idea of immutability is something we'll explore more and more especially when we start talking

02:27.130 --> 02:28.510
about lists.

02:28.540 --> 02:34.430
But for now just remember that you can't reassign part of a string.

02:34.660 --> 02:38.800
Once created it exists like that in that form.

02:38.800 --> 02:42.710
The only way we can change it is to create something new.

02:42.790 --> 02:48.940
We can do selfish plus 8 and we can create it that way.

02:48.940 --> 02:53.410
But now this selfish is a whole new string.

02:53.410 --> 03:04.360
This no longer exists and a whole new shelf space was created for us to use this whole new string again.

03:04.380 --> 03:10.380
If this doesn't make sense to you or why it's important just yet Don't worry we'll get there.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.090
For now though I'll see in the next video by.
