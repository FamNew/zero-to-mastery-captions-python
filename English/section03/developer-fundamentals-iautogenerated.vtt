00:01.090 --> 00:01.680
All right.

00:01.700 --> 00:05.170
This is a big video now.

00:05.270 --> 00:12.030
These videos are going to be sprinkled throughout the course they're developing fundamentals video.

00:12.070 --> 00:19.330
These are the topics that are going to be super super short but important because as a beginner it's

00:19.330 --> 00:24.190
hard to learn these things because you don't know what you don't know.

00:24.190 --> 00:30.370
So what I'm going to try and do in these developer fundamentals is tell you well how to avoid the mistakes

00:30.370 --> 00:36.670
that I made when I got started and what a lot of people do when they get started that is they don't

00:36.670 --> 00:42.480
have a clear path and don't understand what the most efficient way to do things is.

00:42.490 --> 00:47.770
So with developer fundamentals we're going to talk about key things to make you.

00:47.890 --> 00:56.470
First of all efficient in learning python but also make you a programmer that is really really good

00:56.740 --> 00:58.320
and that companies want.

00:58.330 --> 01:02.530
So what is this first developer fundamental.

01:02.920 --> 01:05.830
It's don't read the dictionary.

01:05.830 --> 01:11.550
What does that mean well when you're learning a language such as Python.

01:11.550 --> 01:17.400
You're going to have a tendency especially when you're starting up to try and learn every single thing

01:17.580 --> 01:22.230
every single function every single syntax every single trick.

01:22.230 --> 01:28.290
It's almost like you're trying to learn a language by reading a dictionary from page one all the way

01:28.290 --> 01:28.950
to page.

01:28.950 --> 01:32.680
I don't know a thousand two hundred but that's now how things work.

01:32.820 --> 01:37.920
As a matter of fact when I work with different programming languages I don't know all the syntax is

01:37.950 --> 01:45.150
I don't know all the methods and functions and what a lot of developers do is not necessarily memorize

01:45.510 --> 01:49.350
everything just like you would every single word in a dictionary.

01:49.350 --> 01:54.460
Instead you understand what exists and what you can use.

01:54.510 --> 02:01.680
But you can always google things and most of the time developers are Googling things no matter how experienced

02:01.680 --> 02:02.650
they are.

02:02.670 --> 02:09.120
For example if we go to the Python documentation here we can go through everything right.

02:09.140 --> 02:15.260
I can go through the language reference and read through everything and this is really really useful

02:15.260 --> 02:24.380
information but you're not going to memorize every single thing about the language because there's a

02:24.380 --> 02:25.680
lot.

02:25.870 --> 02:27.960
This is the python language.

02:27.970 --> 02:31.750
And then there's also the libraries the standard libraries that we can use.

02:31.750 --> 02:37.500
And if you sit through here and just read everything in here.

02:37.810 --> 02:41.890
Well you're not going to memorize anything in order for you to actually learn Python.

02:41.890 --> 02:48.310
You have to use the language and you'll notice that some things are used a lot more than others just

02:48.310 --> 02:54.940
like in human languages like when you learn English there's really difficult words that don't get used

02:55.090 --> 02:55.960
that often.

02:55.960 --> 03:04.090
And there's words like and the or or apple that get used very often.

03:04.630 --> 03:11.890
So we're going to learn the language in a way that makes sense in a way that's efficient where we focus

03:11.950 --> 03:19.150
on the 20 percent that gets used 80 percent of the time and all these smaller more complicating things.

03:19.150 --> 03:25.050
We're going to cover but we're not going to cover one by one from start to finish.

03:25.090 --> 03:30.160
We're going to jump around the idea being that when you learn a programming language you're just using

03:30.160 --> 03:37.810
these concepts and slowly you're learning what's out there so that when you have a problem you can identify

03:37.810 --> 03:46.720
it and remember oh I think Python has a path lib library that I can use or perhaps remember that oh

03:46.720 --> 03:49.960
I can use tuples in Python.

03:49.960 --> 03:56.410
So your first developer fundamental is this don't learn a language as if you're trying to get 100 percent

03:56.440 --> 03:57.480
on a test.

03:57.640 --> 04:02.860
We're going to learn a language by actually using it focusing on the things that actually matter.

04:02.860 --> 04:04.660
All right that's enough talking for me.

04:04.660 --> 04:06.440
I'll see in the next video by.
