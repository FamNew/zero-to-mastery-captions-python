00:01.010 --> 00:04.190
Let's learn about the python data types.

00:04.370 --> 00:07.020
All the options we have in Python.

00:07.060 --> 00:12.730
NOW WE'RE BACK TO OUR REPTILE thought I.D. So again write some python code we see over here that we're

00:12.730 --> 00:16.490
using python version three point six.

00:16.540 --> 00:17.350
That's great.

00:17.350 --> 00:22.530
Let's minimize this and start writing our first Python code.

00:22.580 --> 00:30.770
Now we're going to talk about data types and Python has several available to us.

00:31.010 --> 00:35.650
Now I'm going to list them out for you and then we're going to talk about each one individually.

00:35.720 --> 00:43.460
First we have something called it and you see right away when I type I have the ripple already give

00:43.460 --> 00:45.340
me a hint and it's highlighting it.

00:45.410 --> 00:50.850
If I hover over it it shows me that it stands for integer.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.380
We also have something called float.

00:54.590 --> 00:58.760
We have ball which stands for boolean.

00:58.840 --> 01:15.270
We have SDR which stands for string list tuple set and dict.

01:15.290 --> 01:17.300
Now what are these.

01:17.300 --> 01:27.570
These are data types right a data type is a value in python so you can think of it as exactly that values.

01:27.690 --> 01:36.210
So it would represent all numbers for example string will represent all letters for example in a program

01:36.270 --> 01:40.760
is simply instructions that tell a computer what to do and what does that mean.

01:40.830 --> 01:47.860
It's all about storing information or a data type and modifying that information.

01:48.090 --> 01:54.390
We're taking actions on these data types so the two crucial steps when learning a programming language

01:54.660 --> 02:01.500
is that well we have these data types that we need to understand that exist in a language and then we

02:01.500 --> 02:09.540
need to learn how we can manipulate the data create store read change remove this data from the machine.

02:09.540 --> 02:16.140
Now these data types are called the fundamental data types in Python.

02:16.140 --> 02:23.090
They are the core to the language now after the fundamental data types.

02:23.090 --> 02:33.030
We also have something called classes so beyond these data types we can actually create our own using

02:33.030 --> 02:38.250
something called classes so these will be custom types.

02:38.380 --> 02:40.410
Again something that we'll learn about.

02:40.720 --> 02:44.800
So I can create a class that I can name whatever I want.

02:44.800 --> 02:48.060
For example super car.

02:48.130 --> 02:54.560
Now that doesn't exist but I can create it and we'll explore how to do that in the course now.

02:54.810 --> 03:03.500
Besides the fundamental data types the classes which will be arc own custom types we also have something

03:03.500 --> 03:06.320
called specialized data types

03:09.920 --> 03:12.920
and these specialized data types.

03:12.920 --> 03:23.480
They're not built into python but they're special packages and modules that we can use from libraries.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.330
Now again this is a topic that we'll cover later.

03:26.420 --> 03:36.080
But these are you can think of it as extra boost whenever we don't have a data type that we want in

03:36.080 --> 03:42.470
the standard Python package and maybe we don't want to create our own custom types.

03:42.470 --> 03:49.550
There are specialized data types that we can use from what we call modules so you can think of it as

03:49.880 --> 03:52.190
extensions that we can add to the language.

03:52.190 --> 03:55.700
Again something that we'll talk about later on in the course.

03:55.700 --> 04:02.960
And then finally there's another type that is a little special called none and none.

04:03.020 --> 04:09.650
As you can see it's being highlighted which means it means something in the language none as the name

04:09.650 --> 04:12.400
suggests means nothing.

04:12.410 --> 04:18.890
It's kind of like the idea of zero in math it's the absence of value.

04:19.130 --> 04:21.290
It's simply nothing.

04:21.740 --> 04:26.380
And you'll see why this is important in programming later on.

04:26.390 --> 04:32.380
So these are our data types that we're going to talk and we're going to use in our language.

04:32.540 --> 04:37.710
Now we're going to start with the fundamental data types which are nice and simple for us to get through.

04:37.730 --> 04:40.530
So let's start one by one and you know what.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.510
Let's start with these two for now.

04:43.610 --> 04:45.400
I'll see you in the next one but my.
