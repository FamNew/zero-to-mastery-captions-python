Welcome back.

00:02.000 --> 00:13.340
When we talked about lists we saw our special type of none where some methods that worked on lists didn't

00:13.340 --> 00:14.730
really produce anything.

00:14.750 --> 00:21.050
They modified the lists in place but the output of whatever they were doing was this thing.

00:21.050 --> 00:25.520
None remember how we had in their output this none.

00:25.520 --> 00:34.890
What does that mean if you remember I mentioned none as a special data type that exists in Python and

00:34.890 --> 00:41.090
most languages have something like this to represent the absence of value in some other languages.

00:41.190 --> 00:42.420
You might have heard of.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.130
No.

00:43.200 --> 00:48.300
Which is another thing that again represents the absence of value.

00:48.310 --> 00:50.950
Now why is this useful.

00:50.950 --> 00:55.170
Well for now it's hard to really conceptualize it.

00:55.210 --> 00:59.900
We'll see it being used a lot more as we get further into the course.

00:59.980 --> 01:08.110
But I could do something like a equals none let's say for example we're just starting a video game and

01:08.440 --> 01:17.570
in this video game we have a user's weapons but when you're just turning the game there are no weapons

01:17.660 --> 01:18.960
that the user has.

01:18.980 --> 01:24.830
Well in that case we might want to assign the variable weapons maybe in our code or we use this variable

01:25.100 --> 01:29.890
but we also want to know that this user doesn't really have any weapons.

01:29.900 --> 01:31.130
It's not.

01:31.130 --> 01:40.420
So this is completely valid python if I run this I get none.

01:40.770 --> 01:43.790
And we'll explore this a little bit more throughout the course.

01:43.800 --> 01:49.740
Like I said but hopefully this way you're not intimidated when you see it as the name suggests it's

01:49.740 --> 01:50.280
just nothing.
