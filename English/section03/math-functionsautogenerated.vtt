00:00.660 --> 00:01.730
Welcome back.

00:01.740 --> 00:05.670
Let's continue our understanding of int and float.

00:05.780 --> 00:12.320
We talked about the idea of these two data types and how we can use operations on them that we're familiar

00:12.320 --> 00:18.500
with from math class plus a few ones that maybe we haven't seen before such as modulo or the double

00:18.500 --> 00:23.670
slash or the double multiply for the Power of Now.

00:23.700 --> 00:30.390
This is really cool because we can get our computers to do well math for us like a calculator right

00:31.440 --> 00:37.070
but a programming language also provides for us different actions that we can perform.

00:37.380 --> 00:44.140
Now besides these ones we also learned that there's a type action that we can take.

00:44.130 --> 00:51.360
There's a print action that we can take but there's also specific math type functions that enter and

00:51.360 --> 00:56.600
float are able to use that are built into python.

00:56.660 --> 01:01.920
Now these are called well math functions and functions.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.940
Something we'll talk about later on are these actions that we've been talking about remember our diagram

01:08.940 --> 01:09.790
here.

01:09.870 --> 01:15.230
We're starting to learn about the data types and the actions that we can perform on them.

01:15.240 --> 01:21.870
Now in most programming languages these actions are called functions and we have a whole section on

01:21.870 --> 01:22.230
them.

01:22.290 --> 01:26.940
But for now there's some functions that we can use.

01:26.940 --> 01:28.800
So this is a print function.

01:28.800 --> 01:38.070
This is a type function but there's specific math functions such as around and you see right away when

01:38.070 --> 01:47.200
I type Ripple is a tool like an idea that hints and tells us what we can add so says round and give

01:47.200 --> 01:51.190
me a number and maybe an digit.

01:51.330 --> 01:53.110
But let's just worry about the first one for now.

01:53.400 --> 01:57.510
So around if I do three point one and I round here

02:00.760 --> 02:01.640
two.

02:02.010 --> 02:03.470
Well that's not right.

02:03.490 --> 02:04.010
Right.

02:04.050 --> 02:11.220
That's actually the result from up here because we need to also tell it to perform with a function of

02:11.310 --> 02:12.420
print.

02:12.690 --> 02:16.810
Hey print to the screen whatever the result of this is.

02:16.960 --> 02:21.280
And just to make things easier to see I'm going to comment this out.

02:21.330 --> 02:26.760
So I'm just selecting everything and then pressing command slash or if you're on Windows control slash

02:27.300 --> 02:37.260
if I click Run I get three because I'm rounding down the number so let's say it was three point nine

02:37.830 --> 02:46.570
I click and I get four again I'm rounding the number another math function that's built into python

02:47.290 --> 02:56.560
is something called a B S and you see right away that I get a B.S. here and a B.S. returns the absolute

02:56.590 --> 03:03.370
value of the argument and again for those that aren't too familiar with math an absolute value simply

03:03.370 --> 03:05.740
means well no negative numbers.

03:05.740 --> 03:10.340
So an absolute value of negative 20 is 20.

03:10.700 --> 03:15.520
And now because we know about math functions I can start Googling right.

03:15.610 --> 03:21.490
I can say hey I'm a python programmer and I want to learn about math functions well I can go Python

03:22.450 --> 03:28.860
3 math functions and look at that right away.

03:28.860 --> 03:33.560
Google tells me that there is a ton that we can use.

03:33.660 --> 03:35.630
You don't have to memorize all of these.

03:35.670 --> 03:39.890
As a matter of fact some of these I've never ever used in my programming career.

03:40.230 --> 03:44.300
But it's good to know that they have these tools available to you.

03:44.630 --> 03:50.250
And as a programmer this is something that you'll have to get used to the idea that you won't actually

03:50.250 --> 03:59.760
memorize every single action that we can take for each data type because some of these are very rarely

03:59.760 --> 04:00.180
used.

04:00.180 --> 04:02.340
Some of them you'll never use in your career.

04:02.340 --> 04:05.750
The key is to understand how to google them how to find them.

04:05.940 --> 04:10.650
And throughout this course I will show you the important ones that you're going to see over and over

04:10.920 --> 04:17.840
and over but as a way for you to develop as a programmer at least you know that this is how you look

04:17.840 --> 04:24.980
for answers and find out that hey there's different math functions that we can use with numbers.

04:24.990 --> 04:25.380
All right.

04:25.480 --> 04:28.580
Let's take a break and continue in the next video by.
