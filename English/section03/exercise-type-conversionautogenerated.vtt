00:00.640 --> 00:01.740
Welcome back.

00:01.750 --> 00:08.830
So up until now we've learned about integers floats strings and volume values.

00:08.830 --> 00:12.580
So let's try and tie some of those things together.

00:12.670 --> 00:14.740
Let's imagine you are Facebook.

00:15.430 --> 00:17.350
How do you think Facebook works.

00:17.380 --> 00:26.480
Underneath the hood when it comes to your profile well would have let's say a variable called name.

00:26.880 --> 00:33.450
And this will have your name and then they'll probably have a variable with your age.

00:34.520 --> 00:41.770
Let's say 50 not actually 50 but I'm pretending to be for this case just so I sound wiser and then let's

00:41.770 --> 00:45.320
say relationship status.

00:45.430 --> 00:49.900
So again we also have relationship status on Facebook.

00:50.110 --> 00:57.280
And for now let's say single so that's my Facebook profile right there.

00:57.280 --> 01:03.490
Now if we wanted to perhaps change that let's say my relationship status all of a sudden goes from single

01:03.490 --> 01:05.020
to It's complicated.

01:05.590 --> 01:07.560
Well that's an easy fix.

01:07.600 --> 01:12.650
We would just do relationship status equals to.

01:12.820 --> 01:15.470
It's complicated.

01:15.470 --> 01:20.710
I remember because of the single quote we'll have to do backslash

01:24.450 --> 01:27.620
it's complicated.

01:27.850 --> 01:35.420
And now if I print my relationship status you'll see that it's been updated to It's complicated.

01:35.420 --> 01:36.750
I am no longer single.

01:36.830 --> 01:40.980
Hooray but this is pretty simple.

01:40.990 --> 01:45.310
Let's do something more complicated and this is going to be a fun exercise.

01:45.310 --> 01:56.630
Let's create a program that guesses your age let's use the input method that we've seen before.

01:56.930 --> 02:05.560
Remember the input method allows us to type something in here and receive it as input so we can assign

02:05.560 --> 02:06.610
that to a variable.

02:06.640 --> 02:16.570
So let's say this variable is going to be birth year and that's going to equal the input that's going

02:16.570 --> 02:22.630
to ask when or what year where you

02:28.640 --> 02:30.000
now from here.

02:30.110 --> 02:34.690
I want you to pause the video and try to solve this yourself.

02:34.760 --> 02:40.940
How can you make it so that at the end of this program you're going to get asked what year where you're

02:40.940 --> 02:48.080
born you're going to type in your ear and then it's going to print out your age is whatever the ages.

02:48.830 --> 02:50.070
So positive video.

02:50.210 --> 02:54.680
Try and solve this on your own mind you there is a bit of a trick in here.

02:54.680 --> 03:01.700
So if you get stuck try to google around and figure out what the issue may be.

03:01.700 --> 03:09.550
Again part of being a programmer is trying to solve these problems that you don't know the answers to.

03:09.550 --> 03:12.570
All right let me show you my solution.

03:12.590 --> 03:19.590
We have our birth year here that we're going to store in a variable and now we're going to calculate

03:19.590 --> 03:30.420
the h I'm going to say H equals Well it's going to equal the current year let's say 20 19 and then 20

03:30.420 --> 03:38.970
19 here is going to get subtracted from whatever the birth year that you entered.

03:39.750 --> 03:51.300
So let's enter that and then we're simply going to say print your age is and we want to use an F string

03:51.300 --> 03:52.000
here.

03:52.020 --> 03:58.010
So I'm going to add an F here and then simply say

04:02.740 --> 04:08.050
if I run this I get what year were you born.

04:08.100 --> 04:12.030
I was born in nineteen eighty six.

04:12.070 --> 04:13.080
Hmm.

04:13.120 --> 04:21.160
We get an error and if you try this yourself you may have encountered this air we get something called

04:21.340 --> 04:26.590
a Type here and there's lots of errors that you can get in Python.

04:26.590 --> 04:32.410
Again we have a section on air so don't stress too much about it but if you read here it says unsupported

04:32.530 --> 04:40.850
operant type has for minus int and string.

04:41.390 --> 04:44.280
Let's try and debug this.

04:44.300 --> 04:49.580
It looks like we're using minus on an integer and a string.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.800
So let me print out here.

04:53.120 --> 05:06.530
The type of birth year if I run this and let's enter in nineteen eighty six I get class String and this

05:06.530 --> 05:15.350
is a little gotcha because what input does is it asks you for an input but that input that I wrote 1

05:15.350 --> 05:16.750
9 8 6.

05:16.750 --> 05:23.610
Well that actually gets converted to a string and assigned to birth year.

05:23.620 --> 05:33.490
So what that means is that we're trying to subtract a number or a string from a number.

05:33.600 --> 05:42.350
So how do we solve this issue well you'd have to turn this into an integer and this is something that

05:42.350 --> 05:52.130
we saw previously what we need to do is to convert this into an integer with using the int function

05:53.350 --> 06:05.440
so let's try that if I remove this and click Run I'll say 1986 and look at that.

06:05.680 --> 06:13.630
Your age is 33 we've created a program that was able to tell your age based on that year that you were

06:13.630 --> 06:14.860
born.

06:14.860 --> 06:22.450
Now this may have been tricky to you but it teaches an important concept in programming that is sometimes

06:22.450 --> 06:30.490
you storing data into different data types and sometimes you need those different data types to interact

06:30.760 --> 06:34.810
together so you'll see a lot of problems.

06:34.880 --> 06:41.390
Well you have to convert a data type and this is a very common one where you take an input that's a

06:41.390 --> 06:49.530
string and then you convert it to something like an integer so you can perform a mathematical operation.

06:49.530 --> 06:55.110
And that's why if you remember we gave you a list of all our data types in Python.

06:55.110 --> 07:00.930
The fundamental data types and all of them were blue because well each one of these our actions are

07:00.930 --> 07:04.230
functions that we can use.

07:04.310 --> 07:13.160
For example I converted the birth year into integer but I could have also converted this to a float

07:13.400 --> 07:21.920
for example and if I run this it would still work because Python knows that well we can use integers

07:21.950 --> 07:27.380
and floats in mathematical operation but you can see here that it's converted into a float.

07:27.380 --> 07:33.210
Now if we convert this into a boolean and I click Run

07:36.470 --> 07:40.990
Your age is twenty eighteen that's really confusing right.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.920
Well that's because this gets turned into true.

07:46.160 --> 07:54.060
And underneath the hood Python does something weird where a true value is converted to one because boolean.

07:54.110 --> 07:58.040
Remember it's 1 or 0 true or false.

07:58.040 --> 07:58.530
All right.

07:58.610 --> 08:00.850
Hopefully this didn't confuse you too much.

08:00.860 --> 08:03.070
It's something that will encounter throughout the course.

08:03.110 --> 08:05.920
Don't worry we'll get more and more practice.

08:06.140 --> 08:11.540
However I hope you get to practice this a little bit to really understand what's going on because although

08:11.540 --> 08:18.020
this is a couple of lines of code the principles that we use here we're going to use throughout bigger

08:18.020 --> 08:22.390
and bigger code bases so I guess I'll see in the next one by.
