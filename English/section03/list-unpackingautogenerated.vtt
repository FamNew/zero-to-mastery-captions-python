I want to teach you one last thing when it comes to lists.

00:04.010 --> 00:06.230
And it's called list unpacking.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.280
And it's a really really nice feature.

00:08.320 --> 00:11.410
I really like it with list and packing.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.620
We can do something like this.

00:13.930 --> 00:23.980
Let's say I have a list that is while very simple 1 2 and 3 and I want to assign a variable to this

00:24.160 --> 00:24.820
list.

00:24.820 --> 00:25.360
Let's call it.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.150
Basket equals one two three.

00:28.180 --> 00:33.810
But what if I wanted to assign a variable to each item.

00:33.840 --> 00:42.230
Well I can actually do something like this A B C so that when I print a.

00:42.550 --> 00:54.460
And then let's print B and then print c and i click Run I get one two three and this is something that

00:54.460 --> 01:01.570
we've seen when we talked about variables where even if it wasn't a list as long as we gave it by comma

01:01.570 --> 01:07.520
separated by comma different values we're able to print one two three.

01:07.540 --> 01:12.700
But this is where list I'm packing gets really really useful.

01:12.700 --> 01:20.660
We can actually let's say extend our list to include all the way till night.

01:20.730 --> 01:27.880
What if we wanted to unpack one two and three byte but keep everything else still in a list.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.340
Could we still do that.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.330
Well with list unpacking we can't.

01:32.400 --> 01:39.730
All we need to do is say comma and then add a star and give it a variable name whatever we like.

01:39.870 --> 01:42.170
Let's say other.

01:42.340 --> 01:51.270
So now if I print other than I click Run look at that I'm able to unpack my list.

01:51.320 --> 01:58.160
However way I want what if I add a comma here and add D

02:01.040 --> 02:06.120
Well if I run this I get a list all the way until 8.

02:06.240 --> 02:18.130
But now D is well actually the very last item so that's very very neat maybe they use case right now

02:18.130 --> 02:23.590
is not absolutely clear to you but this is something that might help you.

02:23.620 --> 02:31.150
Another tool in your toolbox to unpack a list and change a list in different ways we'll explore this

02:31.150 --> 02:32.910
more later on in this course.

02:33.010 --> 02:36.360
But for now less unpacking when you hear that word.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.140
Now you know what it means.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.760
I'll see you in the next one.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.030
Bye bye.
