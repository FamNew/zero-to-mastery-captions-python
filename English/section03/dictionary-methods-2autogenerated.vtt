00:00.860 --> 00:08.720
By the way there is actually one more way that we've actually seen in list how to look for an item in

00:08.720 --> 00:17.750
a dictionary remember how in lists we use the keyword in we said something along the lines of Hey is

00:17.840 --> 00:27.140
I in a list that contains I or we even used a string like Hi.

00:27.180 --> 00:30.030
Well you can do the same with dictionaries.

00:30.030 --> 00:37.190
I can say does basket exist in user and let's print this out.

00:40.840 --> 00:46.330
And run and it's going to say yep basket does exists in user.

00:46.530 --> 00:50.780
What about what about the size.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.580
Does that exist.

00:52.580 --> 00:53.540
No that's false.

00:53.540 --> 00:55.860
That does not exist in user.

00:56.150 --> 00:59.630
But here is where it gets really interesting.

00:59.660 --> 01:05.270
And this again is a nother dictionary method that we can use.

01:05.330 --> 01:13.610
And by the way you can see that there's not that many dictionary methods that well dictionaries have.

01:13.610 --> 01:24.270
Luckily we're gonna go over the main ones here though one is called Quis and keys simply checks the

01:24.270 --> 01:25.250
keys.

01:25.350 --> 01:27.180
What are the keys of user.

01:27.180 --> 01:36.680
So if I go Hello here and I click Run well no keys ha sorry on this side not this.

01:36.690 --> 01:38.560
So this is a value.

01:38.790 --> 01:48.850
So if I want to check keys I'd say H which is true but if I want to check a values well in that case

01:48.850 --> 01:49.440
if I do.

01:49.440 --> 02:01.960
Hello I get true it's going to go over or what we call iterate over the values another one that's really

02:01.960 --> 02:11.050
useful is the items and items is special because we've seen keys and values but items actually grabs

02:11.170 --> 02:14.260
the entire item.

02:14.360 --> 02:23.020
So the way we can actually see this is let's just remove and click Run All right.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.240
This is interesting.

02:24.240 --> 02:35.080
I have dict items here and I grab looks like a list and in here we have a bracket basket.

02:35.080 --> 02:42.130
One two three greet hello and H20 but there's some weird syntax here that we haven't seen before and

02:42.220 --> 02:44.250
this is actually a topple.

02:44.260 --> 02:49.030
So we're going to hold off on this and talk about this a little bit more when we talk about our next

02:49.180 --> 02:57.220
data structure but keys values and items is an easy way for us to grab these things for us from our

02:57.220 --> 03:02.610
dictionary let's continue on with other dictionary methods that we might use.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.590
One is a very nice one.

03:04.670 --> 03:07.650
It's called Clear.

03:08.020 --> 03:13.710
And if I run this you'll see that I get an empty dictionary.

03:13.900 --> 03:19.400
What if I just run users dot clear here and run.

03:19.480 --> 03:31.350
User Well it's still an empty object or an empty dictionary so you can see here that clear doesn't actually

03:31.350 --> 03:32.610
return anything.

03:32.640 --> 03:33.380
It doesn't.

03:33.390 --> 03:38.050
Well it is just in place removes whatever the dictionary has.

03:38.070 --> 03:40.350
So it just creates an empty dictionary.

03:42.140 --> 03:56.350
What about copy while a copy allows us to copy a user so that if I print user and user 2 and I click

03:56.470 --> 04:01.470
Run I get two users each.

04:01.590 --> 04:03.390
Keys and values copy.

04:03.390 --> 04:14.210
But if I now let's say clear the first user and I click Run the first user is empty but because I've

04:14.230 --> 04:21.930
copied the second user the second user has the old information and this is a concept that we've talked

04:21.930 --> 04:22.850
about before.

04:24.620 --> 04:34.250
Another useful command and let's just go back to having user is user dot pop which removes a key and

04:34.250 --> 04:36.180
a value from the dictionary.

04:36.200 --> 04:45.260
So in our case let's just say we want to remove the key that is age so I'm going to say h and if I run

04:45.260 --> 04:52.220
this I get 20 because pop returns the value of whatever got removed.

04:52.410 --> 05:00.610
But if I do print user now you'll see that age does not exist anymore because we've popped it off but

05:00.610 --> 05:08.730
pop as you can see removes the actual value or returns the actual value 20.

05:08.780 --> 05:12.090
Here's another really fun one pop item.

05:12.320 --> 05:18.440
And honestly this I having used much but I just think it's a fun one pop item.

05:18.440 --> 05:26.330
If you guessed Well you're not gonna guess oh and that's because I have to make sure I write it properly

05:26.510 --> 05:36.140
with lowercase if I run this would just happened it randomly pops off something one of the keys and

05:36.140 --> 05:39.490
the values in this case age 20 is removed.

05:39.490 --> 05:45.820
So the last item on the dictionary gets removed by remember a dictionary is unordered.

05:45.860 --> 05:54.680
So if this was a massive massive dictionary that well doesn't have any order to it sometimes it removes

05:55.250 --> 06:03.620
some pear as you can see not the last one but some pair of key value so you have to be careful with

06:03.620 --> 06:04.100
this one.

06:04.100 --> 06:10.680
It doesn't necessarily just remove the last thing that you entered but it might be useful on some occasions.

06:10.700 --> 06:19.630
Finally we have something called update an update simply updates as the name suggests a key value so

06:20.020 --> 06:20.830
let's have a look here.

06:21.280 --> 06:29.470
All we have to do is give it a new dictionary so curly brackets and just simply say hey I want to update

06:29.650 --> 06:39.390
age to fifty five fight click Run Oh and I forgot a bracket here.

06:39.390 --> 06:40.140
Let's try that again.

06:40.140 --> 06:42.880
If I click Run.

06:43.070 --> 06:43.790
There you go.

06:43.790 --> 06:54.000
Age got updated but if this was a key that doesn't exist like ages and I click run it will still update

06:54.840 --> 06:56.330
with a new key item.

06:57.310 --> 07:00.460
So this is another really useful method.

07:00.490 --> 07:02.850
All right that's it for dictionaries.

07:02.860 --> 07:04.140
I'll see you in the next video.
