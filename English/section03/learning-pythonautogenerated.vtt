00:00.770 --> 00:02.750
Now let's get started shall we.

00:02.750 --> 00:11.240
In order for any programmer to learn a language there are four key things that you need to really master

00:11.480 --> 00:14.870
for any sort of language including python.

00:14.870 --> 00:18.830
First are the terms of that language.

00:18.830 --> 00:25.640
Sometimes a programming language has different awards and different definitions for these words that

00:25.820 --> 00:35.330
you're going to have to memorize things like statements variables instantiation really complicated sounding

00:35.330 --> 00:40.700
words but you need to understand what they mean so that you can talk to other programmers.

00:40.700 --> 00:51.050
You also need to learn about a languages data type that is what sort of data can a program hold.

00:51.240 --> 00:55.080
You can think of it as a values just like in real life.

00:55.080 --> 01:00.090
We have different ways to represent values like numbers letters and symbols.

01:00.090 --> 01:07.140
In programming we have these data types to store information and each programming language has different

01:07.140 --> 01:09.060
sort of data types.

01:09.060 --> 01:12.040
Next we need to learn about actions.

01:12.180 --> 01:20.040
At the end of the day all programming is is a way for us to tell our machines Hey store this data and

01:20.040 --> 01:23.640
then retrieve this data and perform some action on it.

01:23.670 --> 01:28.050
That's all it is just using memory and performing some actions.

01:28.050 --> 01:35.100
So we're going to learn how to perform those actions and then finally we have to learn the best practices

01:35.310 --> 01:36.770
of each language.

01:36.850 --> 01:42.840
There's good ways of writing Python code and then there's bad ways so that when we build our applications

01:42.840 --> 01:49.770
our programs while we don't have a leaning tower like this but we have a solid structure and a solid

01:49.770 --> 01:50.700
program.

01:50.700 --> 01:54.610
So throughout the course we're going to learn about these things but keep this in mind.

01:54.630 --> 02:01.230
These four things are why you need to become a good programmer and I want to start the basic Python

02:01.320 --> 02:03.840
section with the data types.

02:03.990 --> 02:04.770
So let's get started.
