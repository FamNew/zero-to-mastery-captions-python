Welcome back let's talk about a important term when it comes to programming.

00:06.270 --> 00:11.530
And that is operator precedents.

00:11.550 --> 00:13.030
Now what does that mean.

00:13.230 --> 00:17.540
Again we're using our knowledge from math class.

00:17.610 --> 00:28.530
It's the idea that if I do 20 plus three times four it means that different operators have precedence

00:28.590 --> 00:30.560
over different ones.

00:30.620 --> 00:40.600
That is we multiply this first equals to twelve and then 20 gets added to twelve because the Python

00:40.600 --> 00:44.880
interpreter is going to follow a basic set of rules.

00:45.000 --> 00:59.130
For example if I do 20 minus three here and let's print this out click Run I get eight because three

00:59.130 --> 01:06.260
times four gets evaluated first which equals to 12 and then subtracted from 20.

01:06.300 --> 01:14.340
It's not that this goes first and then we multiply 17 by four and this operator precedents shouldn't

01:14.340 --> 01:14.880
be new.

01:14.880 --> 01:15.210
Right.

01:15.210 --> 01:22.620
If you've taken any sort of math class you understand that this is how well math works and this works

01:22.620 --> 01:24.740
the same in all programming languages.

01:24.780 --> 01:28.390
So the order is this first.

01:28.590 --> 01:30.270
We follow the brackets.

01:30.270 --> 01:33.600
So whatever is wrapped in a bracket we do first.

01:33.600 --> 01:38.190
The second is we do the power of.

01:38.190 --> 01:43.410
So whatever is done in the power of will be after parentheses.

01:43.560 --> 01:55.970
For example if I do parentheses here and then to the power of let's say two or less two plus two to

01:55.970 --> 01:57.550
the power of two.

01:57.590 --> 02:05.950
Well the first operation that will happen is 20 minus three because that's the first precedence.

02:06.140 --> 02:13.890
And then we do two to the power of two because that's the next precedence and then only after we do

02:13.890 --> 02:16.170
that we add these two together.

02:16.170 --> 02:21.560
If I click Run I get twenty one which again makes sense.

02:21.580 --> 02:35.170
Seventeen plus four after the power of we have the multiplication and division and then finally the

02:35.170 --> 02:40.040
last precedence is addition and subtraction.

02:40.050 --> 02:42.660
Now this isn't going to be a math class.

02:42.690 --> 02:44.560
Some people really love math.

02:44.580 --> 02:46.570
Some people really don't.

02:46.710 --> 02:51.780
But I want to just give you this basic understanding of operator precedence.

02:51.810 --> 02:52.590
When you see it.

02:52.620 --> 02:55.400
We'll do some exercises here to get accustomed to it.

02:55.470 --> 02:59.880
But trust me this is as mathy as we're gonna get in this course.

02:59.880 --> 03:03.300
The math part of the course is well just here.

03:03.450 --> 03:07.900
It's gonna get a lot more interesting as we learn about different data types.

03:08.070 --> 03:09.390
I'll see in the next one.

03:09.420 --> 03:09.830
Bye bye.
