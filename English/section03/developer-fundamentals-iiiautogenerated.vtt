00:00.360 --> 00:08.900
Let's talk about our next developer fundamentals and this one is understanding data structures a really

00:08.900 --> 00:16.550
good programmer is a programmer that is able to decide what data structure to use when up until now

00:16.550 --> 00:22.070
we've learned about dictionaries and lists and we'll learn about a couple more throughout the course

00:22.820 --> 00:28.970
but a really good programmer a programmer who's experienced is able to understand what the tradeoffs

00:28.970 --> 00:30.630
are when to use what.

00:30.740 --> 00:35.870
And although I can give you a list of this is when you should do this and this is when you should use

00:35.870 --> 00:37.450
maybe dictionaries.

00:37.490 --> 00:40.720
The thing is this takes practice and experience.

00:40.760 --> 00:45.400
So throughout our course and then the exercises that we're going to do the projects we're going to build

00:45.410 --> 00:46.210
at the end.

00:46.280 --> 00:51.950
I hope that this idea of understanding when to use what data structure makes sense to you.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.260
But let's go back to our example.

00:54.500 --> 01:01.370
When should you use a list and when should you use a dictionary Well the first thing we have to realize

01:01.760 --> 01:06.180
that a dictionary is not sorted right.

01:06.260 --> 01:09.740
A list has order it has zero one indexes.

01:09.740 --> 01:10.990
So on and so forth.

01:11.090 --> 01:13.570
A dictionary has no order.

01:13.610 --> 01:21.230
So maybe if you want to have a list of people and line your shop well you should probably use a list.

01:21.290 --> 01:29.480
But maybe you have a user that is playing a game and that user has first name maybe weapons maybe an

01:29.540 --> 01:31.630
H that doesn't have to be ordered.

01:31.730 --> 01:34.020
So you might use a dictionary.

01:34.280 --> 01:39.380
Also you'll notice that dictionaries hold more information than lists right.

01:39.620 --> 01:43.670
Because lists only have that single value.

01:43.940 --> 01:45.270
That is a list.

01:45.290 --> 01:52.490
Has the index and then whatever the value is in here we have a dictionary inside of a list which is

01:52.490 --> 01:54.520
holding a lot of information.

01:54.650 --> 02:00.600
Deep down a list is simply an index in some sort of a value here.

02:00.650 --> 02:01.300
Right.

02:01.340 --> 02:04.560
Versus a dictionary that holds a lot more information.

02:04.640 --> 02:05.830
It holds a key.

02:05.840 --> 02:10.700
So this could be the weapons of that user.

02:10.700 --> 02:21.060
Hello can be the greeting of that user maybe is Magic is another information about that user.

02:21.110 --> 02:24.290
So we're able to have both keys and values in a dictionary.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.790
So it holds a lot more information.

02:26.940 --> 02:32.160
And as we learn different data structures you'll have these different pros and cons.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.910
You'll start to understand as to when to use what.

02:35.910 --> 02:36.630
All right.

02:36.630 --> 02:38.670
There's another developer fundamentals.

02:38.670 --> 02:40.110
I'll see in the next one by.
