00:00.630 --> 00:01.760
Welcome back.

00:01.770 --> 00:04.440
Let's talk about something called escape

00:06.820 --> 00:15.530
sequence in Python let's comment this out and let me ask you a question.

00:15.670 --> 00:20.220
What if we wanted to have a string that tells me let's say the weather.

00:21.130 --> 00:29.770
And here we want to write it's sunny.

00:30.070 --> 00:36.970
You see how the highlighting change here because I want to say it's with an apostrophe S..

00:37.150 --> 00:43.400
But python is reading this and saying OK this is the start of the string and this is the end of the

00:43.400 --> 00:43.910
string.

00:44.060 --> 00:45.620
And then I have no idea what this is.

00:45.620 --> 00:48.470
And then we're starting a string again.

00:48.610 --> 00:51.020
How can we fix this.

00:51.040 --> 00:55.340
Well we can add a double quote string instead.

00:55.570 --> 00:58.240
And this now works.

00:58.240 --> 01:07.670
But what if for some reason we also wanted to add it's kind of sunny in quotation marks.

01:07.670 --> 01:10.480
Well now we have another issue.

01:10.670 --> 01:19.580
So how can we solve this because in human language we have double quotes and apostrophes what we can

01:19.580 --> 01:28.430
use escape sequences here and this is a little hard to understand at first but it's simply adding a

01:28.550 --> 01:39.170
slash like this so the one right above your enter on the keyboard so this slash when Python goes through

01:39.170 --> 01:45.110
it is going to say all right whatever comes after this I recognize this symbol whatever comes after

01:45.110 --> 01:49.420
this I'm going to assume it's a string.

01:49.430 --> 01:59.680
So now if I do backslash here and then backslash here it's going to say hey Python I'm letting you know

01:59.680 --> 02:04.300
whatever comes after this is a string I'm letting you know whatever comes after this is a string and

02:04.300 --> 02:14.010
then I'm letting you know what comes after this is a string so that when we print the weather everything

02:14.040 --> 02:16.260
is printed nicely.

02:16.410 --> 02:18.070
Awesome.

02:18.080 --> 02:23.240
Now this escape sequence can be used in multiple ways.

02:23.270 --> 02:29.990
For example if I want to have an actual backslash Well I can go like this.

02:29.990 --> 02:35.360
And because it's saying whatever comes after this is a string it's going to assume that this is a string

02:35.360 --> 02:35.730
now.

02:35.750 --> 02:42.680
So if I run this you see that we get this backslash and there's a few other neat tricks a can do with

02:42.680 --> 02:43.320
it.

02:43.370 --> 02:50.630
For example one of it is the backslash T.

02:50.730 --> 02:51.900
What does that mean.

02:51.900 --> 02:54.530
Well let's remove this for now.

02:54.540 --> 03:00.130
There you go the backslash t remember well it's out of space in here.

03:00.140 --> 03:04.770
So we can distinguish it is going to say hey whatever comes after this.

03:04.940 --> 03:06.800
I want you to add a tab.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.960
This is a special meaning here.

03:08.960 --> 03:17.010
So if I click on run you'll see that it's added a tab spacing to my string.

03:17.030 --> 03:22.220
Another one is using n or a new line.

03:22.220 --> 03:32.040
So let's leave t here and then add a backslash n and then say hope you have a good day.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.770
What do you think will happen here.

03:35.790 --> 03:42.940
Fact like run I have a tab from the backslash T.

03:43.310 --> 03:50.190
And then I have a new line after kind of Sunny because I do the backslash and which denotes a new line

03:50.660 --> 03:54.190
so that this shows up on a new line.

03:54.200 --> 04:00.290
Now these escape sequences are hard to see at first but they're pretty much available in all programming

04:00.290 --> 04:01.910
languages they use strings.

04:01.910 --> 04:05.960
So if you come from another language this shouldn't be that strange to you.

04:06.080 --> 04:12.020
If it's your first time seeing this you just need to get used to this syntax and every once in a while.

04:12.110 --> 04:17.660
Go to the Python documentation and just type in escape sequences and you'll see all the ones that we

04:17.660 --> 04:18.100
have.

04:18.110 --> 04:21.380
These are the main ones that you need to know.

04:21.390 --> 04:21.900
All right.

04:21.900 --> 04:23.370
More to learn in the next video.
