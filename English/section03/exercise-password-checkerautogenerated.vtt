00:00.480 --> 00:01.630
Welcome back.

00:01.650 --> 00:05.920
Let's try and do an exercise to tie everything that we've learned up until now.

00:05.920 --> 00:10.080
Together we're going to create a password checker.

00:10.080 --> 00:15.970
Now what we want to do is to create some sort of an input that we're going to ask.

00:15.990 --> 00:18.690
So we're going to use the input function.

00:18.870 --> 00:23.180
And here we're going to ask for a user name.

00:23.220 --> 00:26.040
Then we're going to ask for another input.

00:26.040 --> 00:38.380
It's going to be the password and then at the end with the input we want to print something the lines

00:38.470 --> 00:45.900
of password and then we'll have maybe the actual password in here.

00:46.240 --> 00:50.950
And it will say is another variable here long.

00:51.610 --> 01:01.810
So what we want to do is the password and then maybe the password length so that let's say we printed

01:01.810 --> 01:07.570
our user name JJ and then we give it a password of secret.

01:08.200 --> 01:12.550
Well we should print the password.

01:12.550 --> 01:21.910
Secret is 1 2 3 4 5 6 letters long.

01:21.930 --> 01:30.410
Now obviously we all want to show or display the password maybe for security reasons.

01:30.470 --> 01:42.800
So we want to convert this secret to 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 stars so your task is to convert these two and puts

01:44.120 --> 01:44.690
And you know what.

01:44.740 --> 01:48.070
Let's also do a greeting where we say the user name here.

01:48.880 --> 02:01.680
So we're going to say Hey J.J. your password which will be marked in the star is 6 letters long.

02:01.740 --> 02:08.780
Now one neat trick here that you haven't learned yet and you might want to use here is this.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.660
They can do with strings.

02:10.780 --> 02:18.630
I can go star times make sure that the star is a string.

02:18.830 --> 02:21.430
Multiply it by 10.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.300
And if I print this out

02:28.190 --> 02:30.650
I get 10 stars.

02:30.710 --> 02:37.280
So you may want to use this functionality when we're doing this.

02:37.330 --> 02:37.740
All right.

02:37.790 --> 02:38.860
Positive video.

02:38.860 --> 02:39.690
Give it a go.

02:39.690 --> 02:48.790
If you can remember the goal is to print the username and have the password blocked with how many characters

02:48.790 --> 02:51.580
the password is.

02:51.590 --> 02:52.100
All right.

02:52.100 --> 02:52.870
Pause a video.

02:52.940 --> 02:59.360
If not I'm going to get going with the answer so the first thing we're gonna try and do is I'm going

02:59.360 --> 03:00.780
to create two inputs.

03:01.460 --> 03:08.100
So the first one I'm going to get the user name going to assign into the variable user name.

03:08.210 --> 03:13.360
And it's going to say what is your username.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.810
Then the second one will be the password and the password.

03:19.970 --> 03:28.750
Well we'll say what is your password and although this is a simple example this is something that you

03:28.750 --> 03:36.640
will see with other big Web sites like Instagram or maybe Netflix when you're logging in.

03:36.670 --> 03:40.900
So now that I've stored this information into a variable I can use it.

03:40.900 --> 03:41.580
Right.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.560
I can print and we'll do an F string to make our lives easier.

03:46.270 --> 03:47.860
So I've added the F here.

03:47.860 --> 03:59.150
And what we'll do is this will say user name your password and will add the password.

03:59.290 --> 04:12.650
Here is and then we'll add another variable here which is the password length.

04:12.810 --> 04:15.700
So how are we going to calculate that.

04:15.710 --> 04:17.170
Well let's try something here.

04:17.180 --> 04:21.670
Let's see if I can use the length function and in here.

04:21.670 --> 04:23.150
Do password.

04:24.380 --> 04:29.350
Let's see what happens here what is my username.

04:29.390 --> 04:33.790
Let's go with Andre what is my password.

04:33.810 --> 04:36.540
Let's just type in secret here.

04:37.950 --> 04:40.650
I get Andre your password.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.260
Well I can't speak English properly.

04:43.300 --> 04:47.150
My password secret is 6 while 6 1.

04:47.850 --> 04:48.400
That's right.

04:48.400 --> 04:53.290
6 letters long awesome.

04:53.840 --> 05:03.650
So this is working because with an F string I can create or add a python expression in here using the

05:03.650 --> 05:05.520
length password.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.280
But there's an issue here right.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.220
We don't want to actually print out secret.

05:09.220 --> 05:15.470
We want to print it out in these star form and this is a good discussion topping on readability of your

05:15.470 --> 05:16.220
code.

05:16.250 --> 05:22.100
Now this is a simple example but we can make this code a little bit cleaner.

05:22.100 --> 05:34.260
For example we can break things down so that we'll have password length will be length password.

05:34.780 --> 05:36.160
So we're calculating the length.

05:36.180 --> 05:40.490
So this is going to store 6 or whatever the input of our password is.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.030
And it's nice and descriptive.

05:42.040 --> 05:52.930
It's easy for other developers to understand and then in here I can also have hidden password and this

05:52.930 --> 06:03.810
hidden password will be the password length and we're going to use that star string and multiply it

06:03.990 --> 06:05.510
by the password length.

06:05.580 --> 06:12.920
Let's make this a little bit bigger so that now our code can be understood.

06:13.020 --> 06:15.220
Well in an easier fashion.

06:15.390 --> 06:21.740
So we have the password length so we're gonna say username your password password.

06:22.020 --> 06:25.730
But we want to make sure that it's the hidden password so we'll copy this over here.

06:27.850 --> 06:34.670
So username your password we're gonna print out hit and password is and then we're going to copy password

06:34.670 --> 06:36.140
length.

06:36.160 --> 06:44.040
Now I argue that this reads better because each line is doing something simple.

06:44.260 --> 06:46.630
And then finally we're printing the output.

06:47.480 --> 06:54.340
And although this is a small simple example this idea of readability and making and writing code that

06:54.340 --> 06:55.470
makes sense.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.970
Is an important concept.

06:58.310 --> 07:02.380
So let's see if this works when you click on my username.

07:02.660 --> 07:03.740
Andre.

07:03.740 --> 07:10.220
This time around my password is going to be super secret and look at that Andre.

07:10.430 --> 07:15.600
Your password did it it is eleven letters long.

07:15.610 --> 07:17.560
Good job getting this far.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.190
Hopefully you got that.

07:19.270 --> 07:20.500
I'll see you in the next video.
