Welcome back.

00:03.360 --> 00:15.020
I want to quickly talk about something called augmented assignment operator so we've learned that we

00:15.020 --> 00:25.650
can create variables like some value and we can assign it a data type in our case let's just assign

00:25.650 --> 00:33.380
it five there's something called augmented assignment operator that allows us to do something quite

00:33.380 --> 00:34.100
neat.

00:34.100 --> 00:45.170
Let's have a look so if this value I want to increase in let's say 5 plus 2 so add two to it I could

00:45.710 --> 00:54.220
do that or I could even use some value which is already five by the time it gets to line three and do

00:54.220 --> 01:05.440
something like this if I print some value and I click Run I'll get seven because five plus two equals

01:05.440 --> 01:06.180
to seven.

01:06.220 --> 01:16.270
So in memory some value points to seven but there's a neater way of doing this called augmented assignment

01:16.300 --> 01:28.410
operator instead of doing something like this I could just simply add a plus to the equals so we're

01:28.410 --> 01:34.800
going to say some value plus equals two is still going to equal seven.

01:34.800 --> 01:40.650
So it's the same thing as before and this school augmented assignment operator it's a shorthand of us

01:40.890 --> 01:42.550
doing something like this.

01:42.690 --> 01:49.140
We can also change this to something like minus which once again is like subtracting two from whatever

01:49.140 --> 01:54.640
the previous value of some value was.

01:54.650 --> 01:57.400
Now if I was to do this at the beginning here.

01:57.440 --> 02:06.630
So let's just do here and then comment this out and if I click Run I'll get an error because some value

02:06.630 --> 02:07.480
is not defined.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.150
We haven't really created anything.

02:09.180 --> 02:17.690
So in order for this to work we need to make sure that this variable has some previous value so we've

02:17.690 --> 02:20.020
learned about the plus the minus.

02:20.030 --> 02:22.960
And then finally we have the multiply.

02:23.090 --> 02:26.780
Once again if I run this we get 10.

02:26.850 --> 02:35.550
Remember this is just the same as us saying some value times to is just a shorthand form.

02:35.630 --> 02:35.980
All right.

02:35.990 --> 02:39.800
This was a quick video in case you see something like this in the wall.

02:39.980 --> 02:41.630
Now you shouldn't be afraid.

02:41.630 --> 02:46.040
Remember that the operator comes to the left of the equals sign.

02:46.910 --> 02:48.570
I'll see in the next one by.
