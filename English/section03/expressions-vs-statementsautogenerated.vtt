00:00.620 --> 00:03.390
Let's learn another important key term.

00:03.770 --> 00:10.430
Well too for that matter one is expressions and the other one is statements.

00:10.430 --> 00:14.190
You're going to hear this a lot when talking to programmers so what do they need.

00:14.990 --> 00:16.280
Let's have a look.

00:16.340 --> 00:25.400
If we create a piece of code here let's just say IQ is one hundred IQ has lowered and then let's say

00:25.880 --> 00:33.370
user age is going to equal IQ divide by five an expression.

00:33.450 --> 00:36.520
Is this part of the code.

00:36.670 --> 00:41.970
It's a piece of code that produces a value.

00:42.280 --> 00:50.030
In our case this produces a value right because a hundred divided by five is going to equal 20.

00:50.080 --> 00:59.740
So this is an expression a statement on the other hand is an entire line of code not this entire thing

00:59.890 --> 01:05.020
but an entire line of code that performs some sort of action.

01:05.110 --> 01:07.740
In this case what action are we performing.

01:08.050 --> 01:15.220
Well the action is that we're calculating a hundred divided by five and then assigning that value to

01:15.220 --> 01:17.190
the variable user H.

01:17.710 --> 01:20.780
So this is an expression.

01:21.190 --> 01:30.860
This is a statement and also this is another statement so if you hear me mentioning these terms throughout

01:30.860 --> 01:34.170
the course hopefully now you know what they mean.

01:34.280 --> 01:35.910
I'll see the next one by.
