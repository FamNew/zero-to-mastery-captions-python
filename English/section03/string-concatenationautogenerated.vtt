Welcome back.

00:01.960 --> 00:07.870
I want to quickly touch on the subject of what we call string concatenation.

00:08.920 --> 00:17.030
Yes programmers love creating really complex names when concepts may not be as complex.

00:17.110 --> 00:20.440
So what does string concatenation mean.

00:20.440 --> 00:24.900
Well it simply means adding strings together so I can do.

00:24.940 --> 00:31.570
Hello plus Andre and I've concatenated the string.

00:31.570 --> 00:34.330
I've added two strings together.

00:34.330 --> 00:37.820
So if I print this I get.

00:37.870 --> 00:38.290
Hello.

00:38.470 --> 00:44.140
ANDRE So if you ever hear people talk about string Coogan nation that's what they mean.

00:44.570 --> 00:48.170
We're concatenate ing strings by the way.

00:48.200 --> 00:51.170
What do you think will happen if I do.

00:51.170 --> 00:51.930
Hello.

00:52.040 --> 00:52.550
Plus

00:55.320 --> 00:57.180
I click Run.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.260
Hmm mm hmm.

00:59.370 --> 01:09.450
That's not good is it I get type error must be string not int so it looks like string concatenation

01:09.810 --> 01:15.590
only works with strings we'll explore that a little bit more in the next video.
