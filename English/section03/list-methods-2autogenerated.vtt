00:00.450 --> 00:01.340
Welcome back.

00:01.350 --> 00:04.120
Let's keep going with some more stirring methods.

00:04.380 --> 00:10.170
Now we've learned about adding and removing once we learned about a penned insert an extent and then

00:10.170 --> 00:16.690
a removing we learned about pop remove and clear there's a few other important ones.

00:16.770 --> 00:30.160
Let's go with the index so instead of clearing here let's clean this up and we'll do basket dot index

00:31.480 --> 00:36.690
and index as you can see we give it a value a start and a stop.

00:36.790 --> 00:37.930
What does that mean.

00:37.930 --> 00:49.070
Well we want to say hey what index is number two if we do index of two and I click run it's going to

00:49.070 --> 00:50.120
give me one.

00:50.210 --> 00:55.870
I know this is a little confusing but it's asking for the index Where is number two.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.830
Number two is that index of 1.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.300
Let's change these into letters just so it's more clear.

01:02.390 --> 01:07.300
So we have a b c d.

01:07.420 --> 01:19.700
And then finally e and again if I do D here and I click Run I get an index of 3 because 0 1 2 3.

01:19.700 --> 01:22.670
It's on shelf 3 in our memory.

01:22.670 --> 01:29.510
And you can also do a optional parameter here which is where shall we start looking.

01:29.510 --> 01:35.940
So I want you to start looking at index of 0 and then finish looking at index of 2.

01:36.170 --> 01:38.850
If I do run here I get an error.

01:38.900 --> 01:46.340
It says hey D is not in List because while we started at index of 0 and stopped it index of 2 if I do

01:46.340 --> 01:51.580
three and I click Run No it stops right before three.

01:51.610 --> 02:03.180
So if I do four and I click Run there yo I get three now errors are not good or in our programs ideally

02:03.210 --> 02:05.560
we don't want to get errors.

02:05.730 --> 02:07.100
So how do we avoid this.

02:07.110 --> 02:11.190
What if we're looking for something and we're not sure if it's in the list or not.

02:11.290 --> 02:18.150
There's another nifty way of looking for things in that list and this involves what we call a python

02:18.260 --> 02:26.330
key word a key word is something that you use in Python that well already has some meaning.

02:26.420 --> 02:35.080
For example a keyword here if I go to Python keywords are all these wars that already mean something.

02:35.120 --> 02:42.260
Now we're gonna go through them and we haven't seen a lot of them yet but you might have seen true right

02:42.350 --> 02:44.430
in boolean values to mean something.

02:44.810 --> 02:52.220
So in Python we can't really use the word true because well it already means something.

02:52.330 --> 03:00.040
There is a word called in that as you can see as soon as we type means something as a keyword in Python.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.660
And this is quite nice.

03:02.840 --> 03:19.140
We can say hey is D in the basket and if I run this I get true okay is X in basket I get false because

03:19.230 --> 03:27.060
well it doesn't exist and this is actually quite useful and we can even do it for strings for example

03:27.090 --> 03:34.360
if I'm looking for let's say the letter I in a word and let's say it's I in.

03:34.830 --> 03:47.330
Hi my name is Ian if I click Run I get true because the letter I does exist in this string.

03:47.340 --> 03:55.980
All right well let's learn another one Another one is basket dot count and we can count how many times

03:55.980 --> 03:57.690
an item occurs.

03:57.690 --> 04:08.160
So for example if I do D and I click Run I get one because D only exists once in the list but if I add

04:08.160 --> 04:17.580
another D in here and I click Run we get to it counts how many time this value occurs in our list very

04:17.700 --> 04:18.390
very useful.

04:19.320 --> 04:19.800
All right.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.240
A few more still to go.

04:21.270 --> 04:23.850
Let's do some exercises and I'll see you in the next one.
