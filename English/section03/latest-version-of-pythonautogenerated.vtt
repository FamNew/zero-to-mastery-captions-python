Hey this is Andre from the future.

00:02.760 --> 00:03.550
Exactly.

00:03.570 --> 00:10.200
Right after I recorded by videos Raphael decided to upgrade their Python interpreter to version three

00:10.200 --> 00:12.020
point seven point four.

00:12.090 --> 00:12.910
Finally.

00:12.990 --> 00:15.630
So if you're watching the videos don't worry.

00:15.630 --> 00:16.800
This is good.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.420
You want to use the latest version of Python.

00:19.530 --> 00:21.730
All the code is still going to work.

00:21.900 --> 00:27.690
But keep in mind what I said before which is that these versions are constantly going to be upgraded

00:28.110 --> 00:29.040
this time around.

00:29.040 --> 00:35.370
We're using the latest which is great because when we go to Python talk and we go to downloads we see

00:35.370 --> 00:40.590
that three point seven point four is the latest awesome.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.430
All right let's get back to learning.
