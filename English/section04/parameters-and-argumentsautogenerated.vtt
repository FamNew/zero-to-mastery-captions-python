00:00.650 --> 00:08.960
Let's talk about arguments versus parameters which is one of our key terms that we use when describing

00:08.990 --> 00:10.500
functions.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.490
Let's see what they mean.

00:12.520 --> 00:17.020
You see right now are say Hello Function is pretty generic.

00:17.020 --> 00:17.860
Very simple right.

00:17.860 --> 00:19.690
We're just while printing.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.140
Hello.

00:21.210 --> 00:29.520
It's kind of useful but not really the power of functions beyond just being able to call this multiple

00:29.520 --> 00:38.190
times because it only lives in one location in memory is this ability for us to make it dynamic for

00:38.190 --> 00:40.250
example in these brackets.

00:40.380 --> 00:43.370
I can give it what we call parameters.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.430
So in here we give it parameters

00:50.340 --> 00:51.840
inside of the bracket.

00:51.840 --> 00:59.050
So for example I can give it name which is a variable that I just made up I can call whatever I want

00:59.320 --> 01:04.640
and I can leave it like that or I can keep giving it parameters as many as I want I can keep adding

01:04.640 --> 01:07.810
a hundred if I wanted to so.

01:07.870 --> 01:15.720
In this case let's just say this is an emerging so these are two variables or parameters that I've created

01:16.410 --> 01:23.090
and this Say Hello Function is able to receive these two parameters.

01:23.210 --> 01:24.260
What does that mean.

01:24.260 --> 01:28.870
It means that we're able to use these variables inside of this function.

01:29.000 --> 01:39.930
For example I can create this as an F string and say hello and add the name.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.940
And then finally add the emoji.

01:43.940 --> 01:49.920
And because I have these parameters I can use them as variables inside of this code block.

01:50.000 --> 02:00.470
Now these parameters allow us to give the function when we call it what we call arguments.

02:00.470 --> 02:05.720
And by the way the confusion between parameters and arguments people usually say one when they mean

02:05.720 --> 02:06.830
the other.

02:06.830 --> 02:09.980
It's a little tricky so hang in there.

02:09.980 --> 02:17.580
Arguments are used as the actual values we provide to a function.

02:17.810 --> 02:21.100
So now and say hello I can give it a name.

02:21.140 --> 02:27.050
In my case let's just say hi to myself and then I can give it an emotion.

02:27.350 --> 02:34.760
And you see how my editor is giving me the hint that I should give it an emoji because while I defined

02:34.760 --> 02:37.830
it here again something that editors help us do.

02:38.120 --> 02:41.330
So let's just give it just a smiley face with the tongue out.

02:41.420 --> 02:50.600
Now these are arguments these are the actual value we provide to the function and the name of the variables

02:50.600 --> 02:54.020
that we use that we receive are called parameters.

02:54.020 --> 03:01.220
So parameters are used when we define the function and arguments are used when we call the function

03:02.330 --> 03:11.450
defined and call and by the way some people also like saying call or invoking the function or invoke

03:11.630 --> 03:12.140
the function.

03:12.590 --> 03:15.380
So if you ever hear those words you know what they mean.

03:16.790 --> 03:27.610
So if I run this I get Hello Andre with that smiley face and this is when functions get really powerful

03:28.150 --> 03:34.060
because we're able to not just make generic functions that always do the same thing but we can create

03:34.100 --> 03:43.960
a functions that do things based on what parameters we give it or what arguments we call it with so

03:43.960 --> 03:54.130
that now I can use these say Hello Function to say hello to my friend Dan and also my friend Emily.

03:54.270 --> 04:02.090
And if I click Run we've made our function more extensible we can use it in multiple places.

04:02.220 --> 04:08.010
And if we're designing a game well we've just use this to greet our users.

04:08.010 --> 04:16.130
And based on the user name I can use the same function over and over again we're keeping our code dry

04:16.220 --> 04:18.660
and clean by doing something like this.

04:18.740 --> 04:21.840
How cool is that.

04:21.840 --> 04:24.570
All right let's take a break and I'll see you in the next video.
