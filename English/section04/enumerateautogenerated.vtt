00:00.860 --> 00:06.680
Let me show you another useful function that we'll use just like a range.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.550
Mind you it's not as common as range.

00:08.570 --> 00:13.820
Range you'll see it a lot in Python code but this other one is still very useful.

00:13.970 --> 00:16.950
And it's called enumerate.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.680
Now what does it do.

00:18.680 --> 00:19.790
Let's have a look.

00:19.850 --> 00:28.690
I can do a for loop and I'll say 4 and we'll say character in enumerate and then enumerate.

00:28.700 --> 00:32.840
We wrap around something that well we want to enumerate.

00:32.870 --> 00:34.510
So let's see what that means.

00:34.580 --> 00:37.410
It returns and enumerate to object.

00:37.620 --> 00:41.060
So interval must be an other object that supports iteration.

00:41.060 --> 00:45.300
So we have to give it something that enumerate can iterate over.

00:45.320 --> 00:50.540
So this time around let's just do a a string that says hello.

00:50.540 --> 00:58.400
Now enumerate is special because what it's going to give us is it's going to take an editable object

00:58.430 --> 01:03.790
and gives you an index counter and the item of that index.

01:04.040 --> 01:04.970
What I mean by that.

01:05.570 --> 01:09.910
Well you can actually say I comma character.

01:10.010 --> 01:18.020
So we're unpacking this and we're saying hey print I and character.

01:18.020 --> 01:27.090
If I click Run look at that I get Hello iterated over again.

01:27.100 --> 01:31.770
If we don't have enumerate then we would have just gotten Hello.

01:31.900 --> 01:42.670
But we also because we use enumerate we get this eye or index of each item and where it is in the index

01:43.660 --> 01:54.380
so that if I had a list here let's say 1 2 3 again I'm able to use and access the index number of the

01:54.380 --> 01:57.140
item as well.

01:57.220 --> 01:59.260
What if we had a couple

02:04.800 --> 02:15.970
again we get the index number so enumerate is very useful if you need the index counter of the item

02:16.000 --> 02:25.500
that you're looping through so let's do a little exercise let's say that we want to create a script

02:25.800 --> 02:30.410
that enumerates a list of numbers 1 through 10.

02:30.420 --> 02:35.760
So we'll use range to create that I'm going to say list and then I'm going to say range.

02:35.790 --> 02:43.140
I know there's a lot of functions here range that is one hundred and actually list to that and I want

02:43.380 --> 02:50.440
to be told what the index of the number 50 is.

02:50.440 --> 02:53.700
So pause the video if you need to do that.

02:53.910 --> 02:58.830
Now here I want it so that let me make this a little bit bigger.

02:58.920 --> 03:05.070
I want it so that we only print the index of let's say the value 50.

03:05.130 --> 03:09.300
I want to know where 50 is in the list.

03:09.300 --> 03:14.030
Now again this is a simple example seeking probably already guess what the answer is.

03:14.160 --> 03:22.740
But how would you code this so that only in here we get the index of 50 or it says the index of 50 is

03:22.800 --> 03:25.960
whatever positive video if you want to give it a go.

03:25.980 --> 03:39.000
Otherwise let's try this I'm going to do a conditional and says if character is equal to 50 then I'm

03:39.000 --> 03:52.040
going to print index or I'm going to do an F string and I'll say that the index of 50 is and then I'll

03:52.100 --> 03:57.260
add the index in here so that if I run

04:00.230 --> 04:11.230
I get index of 50 is 50 and just to confirm if for example I just print here and let's say print I in

04:11.440 --> 04:22.170
character I click Run we see that map we have the index is the same as the numbers again not too difficult

04:22.230 --> 04:29.130
of a question but you see here that we're able to extract this information again not as useful as range

04:29.190 --> 04:31.200
but you will see it occasionally in code.

04:31.200 --> 04:36.470
So I wanted to make sure that you're not surprised by it as you can see it's not that difficult.
