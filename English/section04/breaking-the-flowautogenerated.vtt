00:00.650 --> 00:01.850
Welcome back.

00:01.850 --> 00:05.480
We learned about our basic Python data types.

00:05.480 --> 00:12.400
We also learned a little bit about some of the terms that we might use when talking about code.

00:12.410 --> 00:18.860
We learned a few best practices but most importantly we learned how to perform actions on these data

00:18.860 --> 00:20.170
types.

00:20.180 --> 00:29.450
We saw that there's built in functions that we can run on any data type such as the print function but

00:29.450 --> 00:34.260
we also learned that most of these data types have their own methods.

00:34.430 --> 00:40.760
That is that dot some sort of a name and then the brackets to perform some actions on them.

00:40.760 --> 00:47.960
Now we're still scratching the surface here but we now go into an area that gets really really exciting

00:48.440 --> 00:57.980
because up until now what we've been doing is this Every time we write code we do something here and

00:57.980 --> 01:01.750
then we go to the second line and do something else.

01:02.000 --> 01:09.520
And then finally go to the third line and do something else and so on and so forth our Python interpreter

01:09.700 --> 01:19.570
just went line by line 1 all the way to whatever line number we have on our DOT pi file and just ran

01:19.570 --> 01:26.810
the code and it ran it really fast because machines are good at that they run code really fast but we

01:26.810 --> 01:34.670
haven't discovered the true power of programming and specifically programming for machines.

01:34.730 --> 01:41.960
You see the power comes when we start to incorporate the idea of maybe running multiple lines over and

01:41.960 --> 01:48.630
over or maybe skipping a line and going from line want to line three and in this section we're going

01:48.630 --> 01:56.490
to talk about the idea of conditions and conditional logic we're going to talk about looping and loops

01:57.120 --> 02:04.080
where we can perform actions hundreds thousands millions of time over and over something that machines

02:04.110 --> 02:05.990
are really really good at.

02:06.120 --> 02:13.680
And that's when programming becomes really powerful because machines can do certain tasks a lot better

02:13.830 --> 02:16.160
and a lot faster than humans.

02:16.200 --> 02:23.760
So we're now going to break into a new world where instead of going from one to three everything in

02:23.760 --> 02:24.320
order.

02:24.450 --> 02:30.000
We're going to start to break some of that apart so that we have more control over our programs than

02:30.000 --> 02:32.160
just going line by line.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.560
Let's find out how to do that in the next video.
