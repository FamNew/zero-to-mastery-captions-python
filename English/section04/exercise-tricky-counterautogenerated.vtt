Welcome back.

00:01.850 --> 00:02.370
Let's try it.

00:02.370 --> 00:04.490
A simple exercise.

00:04.490 --> 00:13.730
I want you to build a simple counter and this counter is going to count the items in our list.

00:13.730 --> 00:14.720
What does that mean.

00:14.720 --> 00:22.210
Well let's say I have a list and this is a reserved word.

00:22.220 --> 00:29.260
Remember it's an actual word in Python so let's name it my list as a variable.

00:29.380 --> 00:42.600
And this list has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 what I want you to do is using looping to loop over this editable

00:42.750 --> 00:49.030
list and sum up the total of the list pauses the video if you need to.

00:49.120 --> 00:59.460
Otherwise let's see how we can do that what I'll do is create a counter variable that will equal to

00:59.460 --> 01:15.810
zero to start off with and then I'll say for item in my list I'm going to counter equals counter plus

01:16.470 --> 01:24.360
item and then at the end I'm going to print counter.

01:24.560 --> 01:32.840
Let's see if this works I'm going to hit run and I get fifty five which if my quick math is right should

01:32.840 --> 01:34.490
be should be correct.

01:34.550 --> 01:39.850
Now when doing this exercise you may have gotten tripped up a bit.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.610
So let's think about this.

01:41.680 --> 01:48.860
Some of you may have made an error where you did the print here but if you did the print here you remember

01:48.860 --> 01:55.790
that it's going to get looped over it's part of this code block because of the indentation and it's

01:55.790 --> 02:03.880
going to print as many times as there are items so you have to make sure that the indentation is like

02:03.880 --> 02:07.110
this so that you get the total.

02:07.130 --> 02:15.410
The other thing that you noticed is that in order for you to keep a counter or a total of all these

02:15.470 --> 02:22.850
items you had to make sure that you had a variable outside of the loop because the loop runs the code

02:22.970 --> 02:26.630
over and over and you needed something on the outside.

02:26.690 --> 02:35.510
That doesn't change because if you moved the counter to zero here well every time the counter would

02:35.510 --> 02:37.150
be reset to zero.

02:37.220 --> 02:41.030
So that by the time we get to 10 counter would be zero.

02:41.030 --> 02:44.070
So you get zero plus 10 which equals 10.

02:44.270 --> 02:54.380
And then you'd get well 10 so you have to be careful here that the indentation is an indication of us

02:54.500 --> 02:59.930
looping and when you loop something and you want to keep a tally or total of something that you have

02:59.930 --> 03:07.490
these issues of making sure that what you want to loop over is inside of this code block but why you

03:07.490 --> 03:12.590
don't want to if you want to have some sort of information that's outside of this loop that you keep

03:12.590 --> 03:16.970
it like this if you weren't tricked by this question.

03:17.020 --> 03:19.330
Good job if you were.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.230
Don't worry it's all part of learning.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.550
I'll see in the next one.

03:22.780 --> 03:23.020
Bob.
