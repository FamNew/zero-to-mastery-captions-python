00:00.480 --> 00:05.930
In order to finalize our understanding of functions we have to talk about scope.

00:06.060 --> 00:10.880
Another one of our key terms what is scope let's have a look

00:13.770 --> 00:24.090
scope is something present in a lot of programming languages and scope simply means what variables do

00:24.090 --> 00:28.920
I have access to.

00:28.940 --> 00:37.740
So what do I mean by that well we've seen this before right where I do print and then let's say Nate

00:38.130 --> 00:47.770
if I click Run I'll get an error a name error name name is not defined because well it doesn't exist

00:47.900 --> 00:48.470
right.

00:48.580 --> 00:55.190
And up to this point we haven't really discussed this but this is because of scope what variables do

00:55.190 --> 01:00.100
I have access to the Python interpreter says hey what do I have access to.

01:00.140 --> 01:05.660
And when we use something that it doesn't understand or doesn't have access to it's going to throw a

01:05.660 --> 01:15.100
name there or a variable is not defined our and scope in Python has what we call functional scope or

01:15.100 --> 01:17.250
function scope.

01:17.320 --> 01:17.980
What does that mean.

01:18.610 --> 01:26.190
Well up until now when we create a variable like total equals to a hundred.

01:26.230 --> 01:29.360
This is part of what we call global scope.

01:29.440 --> 01:35.080
That means anybody on this file has access to this total variable.

01:35.110 --> 01:39.690
I can use this inside of a conditional block I can use it inside of a function.

01:39.820 --> 01:48.150
It has global scope but when I say Python has function scope what I mean is that when we create a function

01:48.810 --> 02:01.540
and let's say we create total as some or let's say some func and we create total inside of the function.

02:01.820 --> 02:09.400
If I print Total here and I click Run I get the same thing name.

02:09.410 --> 02:11.720
Total is not defined.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.830
This is because of Python's function scope.

02:14.990 --> 02:22.510
Anytime we create a variable if it's not inside of a function then it is part of the global scope.

02:22.530 --> 02:23.690
We have access to it.

02:23.790 --> 02:28.150
But you see over here we get that red underline undefined name total.

02:28.350 --> 02:38.140
If let's say for example I had a condition if true then X equals to 10.

02:38.270 --> 02:50.840
If I do this and I say X and I click Run I have 10 because well although I have indentation the only

02:50.840 --> 02:56.560
time I create a new scope you can think of this as a new universe that we spot.

02:56.760 --> 03:02.040
Well we can only do that when we define a function like this.

03:02.070 --> 03:08.400
So think of scope as a new world that we create in our case when we create a function we create a new

03:08.400 --> 03:14.400
world that anything that's indented inside of the function is its own world that we don't really have

03:14.400 --> 03:14.970
access to.

03:14.970 --> 03:23.010
We can only use total if we indent print and it's part of this world.

03:23.250 --> 03:24.780
That's what scope is.

03:25.110 --> 03:27.790
Who has access to who.

03:27.810 --> 03:33.030
So let's take a break here and I want to play a little game in the next video where we try and figure

03:33.030 --> 03:35.860
out who has access to who.

03:36.060 --> 03:37.370
I'll see that one by.
