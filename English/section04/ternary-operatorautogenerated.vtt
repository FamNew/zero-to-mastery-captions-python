00:00.900 --> 00:05.850
I want to talk to you about another way to do conditional logic.

00:05.850 --> 00:17.150
We saw the F L F and then the else statement but there's another way called the ternary operator.

00:17.290 --> 00:26.650
Now this is still the same as the else f or if else statements but it's a shortcut so you can only use

00:26.650 --> 00:33.550
these on certain conditional logic so it doesn't mean that hey this is just the an entirely new way.

00:33.550 --> 00:39.940
This is a shortcut in a sense for you to make your code a little bit cleaner.

00:39.940 --> 00:40.940
Let's have a look.

00:41.020 --> 00:46.290
By the way these ternary operators can also be called conditional expressions.

00:46.510 --> 00:50.840
And when you hear the word expression that should mean something to you right.

00:50.860 --> 00:56.470
It's an expression because it evaluates to a value.

00:56.470 --> 01:03.910
So a ternary operator or a conditional expression is an operation that evaluates to something based

01:03.910 --> 01:06.570
on the condition being true or not.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.800
And it's actually a new feature of Python.

01:08.830 --> 01:10.560
As of version two point four.

01:10.570 --> 01:22.450
So let's have a look the way we use this is to say is condition if this is true then do this.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.520
So this is the condition if true.

01:24.520 --> 01:28.540
And bear with me here it is a little bit confusing at first.

01:28.750 --> 01:36.890
We say if and here we give condition otherwise condition

01:39.710 --> 01:40.530
else.

01:40.570 --> 01:41.320
All right.

01:41.390 --> 01:48.520
That is that is a little confusing so look let's go through it so the f is going to check this condition

01:49.210 --> 01:51.250
so it doesn't actually start with here.

01:51.310 --> 01:59.080
It's going to say hey if this condition now this is going to evaluate to their true or false if it's

01:59.080 --> 02:01.860
true then we're going to do this.

02:02.050 --> 02:04.720
Otherwise we're going to do this.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.210
So let me show you an example of how that would work.

02:10.170 --> 02:14.250
Let's say we're trying to determine if well if a user is your friend.

02:14.280 --> 02:17.330
So we'll say is a friend.

02:17.570 --> 02:21.150
And here we can set to True or false for a friend.

02:21.160 --> 02:28.590
Maybe we can check on Facebook if users can message you or on Twitter whether Twitter users can give

02:28.590 --> 02:30.240
you direct messages.

02:30.240 --> 02:36.120
Well here and let's do can message.

02:36.380 --> 02:40.220
And here we can do our ternary operator.

02:40.220 --> 02:49.010
We're going to say message aloud If so this is if the condition is true the condition is hey is this

02:49.010 --> 02:50.960
person your friend.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.350
Otherwise condition.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.140
That is false.

02:54.140 --> 03:03.320
Well I'm going to say not allowed to message and you can see here that this is a one liner though it

03:03.320 --> 03:04.360
looks like two lines.

03:04.370 --> 03:09.530
But you can see over here that it's not really is just that we're wrapping so we can see the entire

03:09.530 --> 03:17.860
code so let's run this and see what can message prints.

03:17.940 --> 03:27.960
If I run this message is allowed because well we've assigned message aloud to Ken message because while

03:27.960 --> 03:36.260
the condition was true if this person wasn't my friend and I run this not allowed to message because

03:36.250 --> 03:42.780
of the condition that if condition evaluates to false I know the ordering here can be a little bit confusing

03:42.780 --> 03:49.710
so you might have to look at it a couple times and you do need to use it a few times to really remember

03:49.710 --> 03:59.970
it but this is the general rule condition if true if condition else condition if not a false if false

04:00.830 --> 04:02.220
can't spell.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.140
All right.

04:03.210 --> 04:10.530
A nice shorthand way to do something when a condition is either true or false or evaluates to true or

04:10.530 --> 04:11.790
false.

04:11.790 --> 04:13.850
All right I'll see you in the next video.

04:13.860 --> 04:14.070
Bobby.
