00:00.650 --> 00:06.020
Hey long time no see it's it's been a while but I'm glad you're back and I'm I'm glad you're still hanging

00:06.020 --> 00:06.700
in there.

00:06.800 --> 00:11.720
Trust me thinks things are going to get a lot more fun once we actually start building applications.

00:11.720 --> 00:15.710
But we do have to go through the basics so hang in there.

00:15.710 --> 00:23.060
Now you may have heard me mention methods and functions before and I briefly touched on the subject

00:23.090 --> 00:23.760
right.

00:23.810 --> 00:32.980
We have functions like list print we have things like Max man what else do we have.

00:32.990 --> 00:34.370
We have input.

00:34.370 --> 00:38.290
These are all built in functions in Python.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.800
Python just comes with this and we're able to use them.

00:41.330 --> 00:48.380
And we also learned about functions that we can create ourselves custom functions like well some random

00:49.610 --> 00:57.970
stuff and I just created a function that does absolutely nothing I can just pass through and these are

00:57.970 --> 01:06.640
all functions because the way we call them is Well we say some random stuff and then we call it with

01:06.640 --> 01:14.950
the brackets and give it some sort of data or leave it empty but we also learned about methods and methods

01:14.950 --> 01:22.170
were different because the way we used them was using the dot notation we said Dot something.

01:22.180 --> 01:32.580
For example if we had a string hello and I do dot I get a list of all these methods that the string

01:32.730 --> 01:34.880
data type can use.

01:35.010 --> 01:42.450
These aren't things that we can use like this because if I do capitalize

01:45.170 --> 01:49.370
like this well it's going to give me an error.

01:49.460 --> 01:55.920
It's going to say well I'm going to get an error with Max because it's expecting an argument here bullets

01:56.220 --> 02:04.910
comet this out and click Run Again I get named capitalized is not defined because it's not a function

02:05.360 --> 02:13.460
it's a method and then method has to be owned by something and who owns a method well whatever is to

02:13.460 --> 02:25.590
the left of the dot in our case the string owns the method capitalized and that's what methods are they're

02:25.940 --> 02:35.100
built in objects that have methods such as strings dictionaries sets topples all the things we've talked

02:35.100 --> 02:43.980
about where as soon as we do dot we have access to all these methods they're owned by an object or a

02:43.980 --> 02:44.510
data type.

02:45.150 --> 02:52.560
And the fun thing is that there's a ways to build your own methods and I'll show you how to do that

02:52.560 --> 02:58.680
later on and when we start talking about classes but he can see here that our editors help us determine

02:58.890 --> 03:01.040
what type of methods that we can use.

03:01.140 --> 03:09.600
And again these are built into python and you can also learn about these methods that we can use by

03:09.600 --> 03:11.610
going to the Python documentation right.

03:11.610 --> 03:19.860
Python 3 documentation is going to have a ton of things for us if we go to library reference for example

03:20.160 --> 03:22.770
we can see here that we can learn about built in types.

03:22.770 --> 03:26.260
So let's go to let's go to the set types.

03:26.490 --> 03:29.840
And here you can see that we have set type.

03:29.970 --> 03:31.470
And it shows us how we can use it.

03:31.680 --> 03:37.200
Now Python doesn't have the easiest documentation to read for beginners unfortunately.

03:37.320 --> 03:44.640
So sometimes it's better to actually just Google instead of going through the actual documentation but

03:44.640 --> 03:53.260
you see here that the set type has clear has pop has remove if we want to use it we have update.

03:53.400 --> 04:01.710
And these are the methods that we can use but at the end of the day both methods and functions allow

04:01.710 --> 04:09.780
us to take actions right to take actions on our data types to have our programs do something.

04:09.780 --> 04:15.150
And although they have these different names and one has a dot in front of it and another one while

04:15.150 --> 04:17.310
we can just call it like this.

04:17.310 --> 04:19.380
The difference is very minimal.

04:19.410 --> 04:24.580
But keep that in mind when you hear people talking about methods and functions there is that difference.

04:24.600 --> 04:29.610
And like I said before we will get two methods when we talk about classes to show you how we can create

04:29.910 --> 04:30.760
our own.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.170
I'll see in the next one.

04:32.330 --> 04:32.550
Bob.
