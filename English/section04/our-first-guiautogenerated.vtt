00:00.550 --> 00:01.880
All right.

00:01.910 --> 00:05.930
Your head must be spinning because of all these looping.

00:05.930 --> 00:06.250
That's.

00:06.410 --> 00:07.420
That's a really bad joke.

00:07.430 --> 00:11.540
But I thought it was funny because I've been recording for hours now and I think I'm going a little

00:11.540 --> 00:11.990
kooky.

00:11.990 --> 00:15.060
So this is going to be my last video for the day.

00:15.110 --> 00:16.360
Now for the course.

00:16.370 --> 00:19.060
But we're gonna do a little fun exercise.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.410
Now I call all exercise is fun.

00:21.410 --> 00:25.660
Obviously I'm biased but this one this one's especially fun.

00:25.670 --> 00:28.490
Where are we going to do well.

00:28.550 --> 00:35.210
We're going to simulate what a computer does when when we have something like a graphical user interface

00:35.600 --> 00:40.490
that is a computer is able to display let's say even an image over here right.

00:40.490 --> 00:44.450
I can see the robot over here I can see the mouse.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.420
This is a graphical user interface.

00:46.430 --> 00:49.130
I see pictures I see images on my screen.

00:49.130 --> 00:53.060
These pixels on my screen and I can control them.

00:53.120 --> 01:00.620
Well we're going to create a basic version of this to show you how a computer would work just from the

01:00.620 --> 01:02.520
stuff that we've learned up until now.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.600
Using loops and using conditional logic.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.950
So what are we going to do.

01:08.210 --> 01:10.900
Well this is the exercise.

01:11.090 --> 01:17.420
And you can check out the reptile here or you can recreate this or again in this video you should have

01:17.420 --> 01:22.260
resources attached that you can play with it yourself.

01:22.340 --> 01:27.440
And what I want you to do is I want you to loop through this list of lists.

01:28.070 --> 01:37.650
And every time you encounter a zero I want you to display on the screen over here an empty space because

01:37.720 --> 01:41.280
zero in a computer denotes nothing right.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.830
We want a blank on the screen.

01:43.830 --> 01:51.510
However when I see a one I want to simulate a pixel right that tiny tiny dot on our computers that can

01:51.510 --> 01:53.190
be full of colors it could be green.

01:53.190 --> 01:55.170
It can be blue can be orange.

01:55.170 --> 02:00.090
But for our case I want it to be a star and using that.

02:00.090 --> 02:06.450
I want you to create a program that takes this picture that let's say is in our database or in our computers

02:06.450 --> 02:12.660
hard harddrive and displays it on the screen using space for multiply.

02:13.080 --> 02:20.260
And all I want you to do is when I click Run I want you to display that image right here.

02:20.340 --> 02:20.760
All right.

02:20.760 --> 02:24.230
This is a little tough one and I'm kind of letting you figure out on your own.

02:24.240 --> 02:28.530
But trust me you've learned all the tools necessary to do this.

02:28.560 --> 02:29.580
Pause the video.

02:29.760 --> 02:30.390
Give it a go.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.690
Otherwise I'm going to show you how it's done.

02:34.280 --> 02:38.950
So the very first thing I like to do is to think about what I'm about to do.

02:39.050 --> 02:40.920
I want to make sure that we have a plan in mind.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.190
So I'm going to comment first and I'm going to say well we definitely want to iterate over a picture.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.190
Right.

02:49.250 --> 02:51.680
So we're going to do some sort of iteration here.

02:51.680 --> 03:05.970
So that's number one and then in here I want to say that if it's a zero then I want to print an empty

03:05.970 --> 03:17.460
space and if it's a one I want to print a star.

03:17.520 --> 03:17.900
All right.

03:17.910 --> 03:18.840
So that's the plan.

03:19.680 --> 03:19.890
OK.

03:19.890 --> 03:24.080
So this shouldn't be too hard actually.

03:24.300 --> 03:32.490
Before you get started in order for this to work you need to google a special parameter or special option

03:32.490 --> 03:40.140
that you can give the print function and as a matter of fact the print function that you need to add

03:40.140 --> 03:44.840
or the option that you need to add is this and option.

03:45.060 --> 03:52.730
And if we scroll down it doesn't display that well I can see here string appended after the last value.

03:52.930 --> 03:56.670
So the default when we print something is a new line.

03:56.710 --> 04:00.620
But ideally we might not want a new line.

04:00.670 --> 04:06.120
So when that happens you might have to use this and option.

04:06.170 --> 04:08.030
Now I know I left it really vague.

04:08.030 --> 04:08.360
I want to.

04:08.390 --> 04:13.520
I want you to practice googling this and and figuring out from your mistake you're gonna have a bug

04:13.550 --> 04:21.230
when you create this code when you try to display this information but try to solve it using the tools

04:21.230 --> 04:24.280
that you have of problem solving.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.330
All right enough talk.

04:25.330 --> 04:31.260
Let's get to it so the first thing I want to do is iterate over the picture.

04:31.360 --> 04:41.010
I'm going to say for image in the picture because well this is one picture right here.

04:41.050 --> 04:47.140
So this is the picture but it's inside of a list because we can have multiple pictures and then I'm

04:47.140 --> 04:52.510
going to loop once again over this individual list.

04:52.510 --> 04:59.050
So once again I need to do a for loop and this time I want to say for pixel because each one of this

04:59.050 --> 05:03.570
is a pixel in the image.

05:03.570 --> 05:06.070
So this is a nested for loop.

05:06.100 --> 05:15.960
Now I'm going to add a conditional and say if pixel equals one then I'm going to

05:19.040 --> 05:24.320
a star.

05:24.540 --> 05:25.230
Otherwise

05:28.090 --> 05:33.320
I'm going to print an empty string.

05:33.320 --> 05:35.960
Well maybe not empty right.

05:35.960 --> 05:41.990
Because we do want a space a blank space in the image.

05:42.020 --> 05:44.980
All right so let's see if this works.

05:46.240 --> 05:52.610
If I click Run that's not really why I wanted.

05:52.850 --> 05:57.990
I want a clear image here but I'm just getting things one in line.

05:58.130 --> 06:07.840
And remember this was the little trick where a print every time it prints it creates a new line the

06:07.840 --> 06:18.240
default again if we close this you'll see is that end equals to this escape sequence of new line.

06:19.170 --> 06:28.430
So we can change that by simply saying star comma end and then I'm going to say for the end I don't

06:28.430 --> 06:37.980
want a new line I just want well a string but an empty string and same over here I do comma

06:41.800 --> 06:46.470
and and if I click Run All right.

06:46.950 --> 06:52.590
It's getting a little bit better but now I have an issue where we don't have any new lines.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.820
Everything is on one line.

06:56.290 --> 06:56.920
That's not good.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.990
How can we solve this.

06:58.990 --> 07:05.590
Well ideally the end of this first loop where we're just going.

07:05.590 --> 07:10.840
The image or the line in the image at the end of this.

07:11.020 --> 07:13.650
We create a new line right here.

07:13.870 --> 07:14.580
Right.

07:14.590 --> 07:22.500
So again looking at the indentation I don't want a new line on every pixel which we had the first time.

07:22.500 --> 07:31.720
But I also want to add a line between the lists of rows so maybe a better name for this will be a row

07:31.990 --> 07:38.890
in picture and in here I'm going to add the end of this for loop.

07:38.890 --> 07:48.250
So after we're done looping through the entire row at the bottom here I'm going to print an empty line.

07:48.250 --> 07:52.350
But remember the default is going to be a new line.

07:52.440 --> 07:53.700
So again an empty string.

07:53.700 --> 07:55.630
It's going to default to a new line.

07:56.100 --> 08:04.990
And we're still going to have this code if I run this so I get an error because image is not defined

08:05.020 --> 08:07.180
because I've just changed this to a row.

08:07.200 --> 08:14.270
So let's do row here click Run and look at that.

08:14.350 --> 08:16.810
We have our beautiful Christmas tree.

08:16.900 --> 08:18.280
If you don't think this is beautiful.

08:18.310 --> 08:25.110
This is the best I could but this is a Christmas tree and we finally have a display.

08:25.110 --> 08:31.320
We've used loops we've used conditional logic and we used a little googling to figure out hey we we

08:31.320 --> 08:32.700
need this option.

08:33.090 --> 08:36.000
Now our code works.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.060
But I want to do something better here and in the next video I want to clean up this code a little bit

08:42.720 --> 08:46.620
and cover a very important topic when it comes to programming.

08:46.740 --> 08:47.990
I'll see on that one by.
