00:00.570 --> 00:01.020
All right.

00:01.030 --> 00:02.400
It's exercise time.

00:02.410 --> 00:06.190
Let's combine everything that we've learned into this challenge.

00:06.250 --> 00:13.570
What I want you to do is to create a function called the highest even and this function is going to

00:13.570 --> 00:15.940
take a list data.

00:16.780 --> 00:20.190
And this function for now we'll just pass.

00:20.290 --> 00:25.800
But I want you to fill in this part with whatever you think is going to allow us to achieve this.

00:25.840 --> 00:38.500
If I do print highest even and I give it a list of let's say 1 2 3 4 8 I want the highest even to be

00:38.500 --> 00:40.060
printed in this list.

00:40.060 --> 00:42.140
And actually let's do 10 here.

00:42.220 --> 00:48.240
So the highest even number in this list is 10 just for fun.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.370
That's at eleven as well.

00:50.430 --> 00:58.200
So the answer should be printed here as 10 so based on everything you've learned so far.

00:58.210 --> 01:01.720
Try to fill this part so that you create your own function.

01:01.730 --> 01:04.420
Hi Stephen pause the video here.

01:04.420 --> 01:08.660
Give it a try otherwise I'm going to go with the answer.

01:08.700 --> 01:10.290
So what I want to do here.

01:10.350 --> 01:17.640
Let's think about this is I want to make sure that first of all we only consider the numbers that are

01:17.850 --> 01:27.890
even in here so maybe what I'll do is create a new list called evens and events is going to be an empty

01:27.890 --> 01:36.180
list for now but I'm going to populate this with all of the even numbers so I'm going to remove three

01:36.180 --> 01:40.090
and 11 from this so let's do that.

01:40.090 --> 01:53.500
I'm going to say for item in ally if item modulo 2 equals zero which means it's going to be even then

01:53.500 --> 01:59.110
I'm going to even append the item.

01:59.110 --> 02:03.120
So I'm going to add it to this new list.

02:03.350 --> 02:12.850
And then finally in here once we have the Evens list I want to find the highest number.

02:12.890 --> 02:20.390
Now you can do this manually and go through it one by one or Python comes with a nice function called

02:20.600 --> 02:21.410
Max.

02:21.410 --> 02:28.400
And as you can see we give it an interval and it'll tell us what the max number is in our case we can

02:28.400 --> 02:34.680
just give it evens and remember we want to return something from this function.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.620
That is what is the highest number.

02:37.650 --> 02:41.750
Well we want to return whatever the max of the Evens is.

02:42.030 --> 02:50.220
If I run this I get 10 awesome looks like it's working.

02:50.320 --> 02:56.230
Now some of you may have gotten tricked and tried to return inside of the four.

02:56.770 --> 03:05.830
But if we do this remember that this still works but we actually return from the function when we hit

03:05.860 --> 03:07.210
our first item.

03:07.300 --> 03:17.000
If we had another item let's say two in here and I click Run we get two and why is that.

03:17.000 --> 03:25.210
Because I'm returning when we loop the first time through our item which will be two is to an even number.

03:25.220 --> 03:25.760
Yes it is.

03:25.760 --> 03:34.050
So we're going to append and then we're finally returning Max evens which only contains the item two.

03:34.100 --> 03:39.410
So you want to make sure here that the indentation really matters and if you're returning something

03:39.650 --> 03:45.410
from inside a loop you want to make sure that that's your intended behavior.

03:45.530 --> 03:49.630
You usually want to loop through something and then return.

03:49.730 --> 03:55.450
So make sure you don't prematurely exit the loop nice and simple.

03:55.450 --> 03:59.250
Remember your answer may be different than mine.

03:59.290 --> 04:06.820
There are many ways to go about this but hopefully by practicing this you have a better idea of functions.

04:06.820 --> 04:14.330
We now have a great utility function highest even that we can use all over our program.

04:14.390 --> 04:17.690
Good job getting this far and I'll see you in the next one up.
