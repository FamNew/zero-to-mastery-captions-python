Promise to not get mad at me.

00:02.280 --> 00:07.980
But there's actually one other thing I forgot to mention before we can talk about decorators.

00:07.980 --> 00:09.660
I know I'm building the suspense.

00:09.660 --> 00:13.280
I know you're just thinking hey hey Ondrej tell me what a decorator is.

00:13.290 --> 00:14.200
You're wasting my time.

00:14.460 --> 00:15.670
But one more thing.

00:15.690 --> 00:17.100
Quick video I promise.

00:18.060 --> 00:29.550
We have to understand this idea of a higher order function that is a higher order function for HFC for

00:29.550 --> 00:30.210
short.

00:30.300 --> 00:31.780
Sounds super important.

00:31.780 --> 00:37.570
Right a higher order function can be one of two things.

00:37.750 --> 00:48.660
It could either be a function let's say the great function that accepts a another function so this right

00:48.660 --> 00:52.270
here is a higher order function.

00:52.290 --> 00:56.640
It's a function that accepts inside of its parameters.

00:56.640 --> 01:05.860
Another function another way it can be a higher order function is if its a function that returns another

01:05.860 --> 01:06.790
function.

01:06.790 --> 01:18.820
If we define let's say a greet two that just runs normally but instead returns another function.

01:18.820 --> 01:29.240
So let's say in here we have define func and this define func let's say just returns five and we return

01:29.240 --> 01:30.090
the function.

01:30.140 --> 01:37.400
This is a higher order function a higher order function is any function that either accepts a function

01:38.150 --> 01:43.610
as a parameter or returns a function.

01:43.610 --> 01:47.940
And if you're thinking hey is that map function that we talked about.

01:47.990 --> 01:49.390
Is that a higher order function.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.110
Because it accepts a function.

01:51.410 --> 01:53.130
Yep that's a higher order function.

01:53.240 --> 01:57.800
So ways reduce or filter.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.720
These are all higher order functions.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.010
All right I promise.

02:03.050 --> 02:08.390
In the next video we're going to talk about why this is important and what decorators are.

02:08.720 --> 02:09.510
I'll see in that one.
