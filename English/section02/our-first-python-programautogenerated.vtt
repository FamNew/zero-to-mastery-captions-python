00:00.860 --> 00:03.290
Hey you're still sticking your round.

00:03.290 --> 00:03.710
That's good.

00:03.710 --> 00:10.460
I didn't bore you with all my talking but yes in this video finally we're going to write some python

00:10.760 --> 00:11.540
code.

00:11.540 --> 00:12.190
Holy moly.

00:12.200 --> 00:12.610
Thank God.

00:12.620 --> 00:14.860
I thought that was going to last forever.

00:14.950 --> 00:15.670
All right.

00:15.770 --> 00:18.450
So what is our first program going to do.

00:19.190 --> 00:22.910
Well let's create a very very simple function.

00:23.570 --> 00:29.870
And probably the first thing any programmer learns to do to print our own name.

00:30.110 --> 00:39.230
So in here once you have your rebel thought I.T. setup or remember you can also use got that Io we're

00:39.230 --> 00:40.610
simply going to write.

00:40.610 --> 00:48.150
Print and then you see over here that it gives us some information but all we want to do is write brackets

00:49.260 --> 00:56.870
a quote so we can do double quotes here or a single quote and just type your name.

00:59.420 --> 01:08.440
And if we click run on the right side we've just run our very first python program.

01:08.610 --> 01:12.570
Very exciting but what's happening here.

01:12.570 --> 01:14.680
Well let's let's look at everything.

01:14.730 --> 01:17.550
First of all if you're confused why.

01:17.550 --> 01:20.850
My thing is dark and yours might be light.

01:20.970 --> 01:27.510
It's because if I go to settings I've set my theme too light or too dark.

01:27.510 --> 01:28.820
I prefer the dark version.

01:28.950 --> 01:34.380
But you can change some of your settings you can change the font size if you want based on when you

01:34.380 --> 01:35.300
watch the video.

01:35.310 --> 01:41.420
This Web site the look might be different but most of the settings should be the same we see that we

01:41.420 --> 01:52.750
have a main dot pie which is the python extension any file that has a dot Pi or P Y is a python file.

01:52.790 --> 02:00.180
So while we've just written here on line one is a program that prints.

02:00.350 --> 02:04.640
In this case Andre now goy or in your case your own name.

02:04.820 --> 02:12.800
And we've written it to this file now wrap all that i t takes this file already has this interpreter

02:13.740 --> 02:23.460
for us it runs this piece of code gives this source code of main dot pi to the interpreter and runs

02:23.460 --> 02:25.860
it right here on our right side.

02:26.190 --> 02:30.790
If you look over here we're using python version three point six point one.

02:30.960 --> 02:36.870
And down below we see that we have Andre Bagley printed.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.680
That's awesome.

02:38.780 --> 02:42.120
So this is our code running.

02:42.220 --> 02:50.440
Remember this diagram all we've done is we have our main dot pi where we wrote print Andre Agassi we

02:50.440 --> 02:58.780
gave it to the interpreter that the ripple already provides for us that interpreter takes our code converts

02:58.780 --> 03:07.460
it into byte code in here he'll say Andre Agassi and then it runs it in the C Python VM which was on

03:07.460 --> 03:13.880
the right side that we saw and it finally prints our name because it tells the machine hey we want that

03:14.030 --> 03:15.460
text printed.

03:15.620 --> 03:17.290
So that's what we're seeing here.

03:17.360 --> 03:24.230
This is the C Python virtual machine essentially running this code and telling this machine Hey I want

03:24.230 --> 03:25.820
you to print this.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.410
All right but this isn't very exciting.

03:28.420 --> 03:33.400
I mean let's let's make this program a little bit more dynamic for our first program we want to do something

03:33.400 --> 03:36.340
more impressive than just print name.

03:36.340 --> 03:40.900
So I'm going to teach you a another thing we can do in Python.

03:41.050 --> 03:51.270
And it's called input now in here I can say input and you see that ripple it actually gives me some

03:51.900 --> 03:58.450
information saying that oh I have this you can just click here and this input over here.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.700
Well what can we do.

03:59.850 --> 04:02.640
This input is going to prompt a user.

04:02.730 --> 04:10.050
And if I hover over it you can see how it's giving me some information but input simply gives us a way

04:10.050 --> 04:11.910
to capture information.

04:11.910 --> 04:24.800
So let's say what is your name and if I run this code we see that we have our Python code running and

04:24.800 --> 04:28.170
it's asking me what is my name with this cursor here.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.980
So I can actually type something here.

04:30.110 --> 04:36.190
I can say Andre and if I hit enter.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.970
Well there you go.

04:37.970 --> 04:41.720
I've just typed in my own name.

04:41.720 --> 04:42.860
Nothing that exciting.

04:42.920 --> 04:43.640
Right.

04:43.820 --> 04:51.420
But this is where code becomes interesting because we can store this information on our computer.

04:51.480 --> 04:57.570
So again these are things that we're going to go over in detail in our basics Python section.

04:57.780 --> 05:06.630
But just to write our first code well let's assign this too memory that is let's say that name equals

05:06.960 --> 05:11.760
whatever is the input of what is your name.

05:11.870 --> 05:20.560
And then finally we can just print the name so remember the interpreter is going to take this first

05:20.560 --> 05:24.750
line it's going to ask what is your name.

05:24.770 --> 05:32.750
I'm going to type something that typed information is going to get assigned to name and then finally

05:32.930 --> 05:35.280
we print name.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.560
Remember an interpreter takes.

05:37.610 --> 05:40.480
Line by line converts code to bite code.

05:40.490 --> 05:44.300
And then finally runs it so let's give this a try.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.820
I'm going to click Run.

05:46.840 --> 05:47.080
All right.

05:47.110 --> 05:48.550
What's your name.

05:48.550 --> 05:56.190
My name is Andre do you see the I typed in my name.

05:56.360 --> 05:59.230
Hit enter and then it printed out.

05:59.300 --> 06:05.090
ANDRE So for the final feat let's greet.

06:05.280 --> 06:10.070
So we're going to say print Hello.

06:12.490 --> 06:14.550
And then plus name.

06:14.710 --> 06:16.390
Now don't worry about the syntax.

06:16.400 --> 06:24.610
We're gonna go over it but all we're doing is saying hello and then adding our name to the end of this

06:25.720 --> 06:29.650
so let's see what happens if I run this and say What is your name.

06:30.160 --> 06:36.330
My name is Andre and I hit enter I get Hello Andre.

06:36.330 --> 06:44.300
But no spaces so let's add a little space hit run again for the fourth time My name's Andre and says

06:44.480 --> 06:54.300
Hello Andre there it is our first python program now it's not very exciting because it is our first

06:54.300 --> 07:01.200
program we're just learning the steps here but I hope because we've covered some of these topics ahead

07:01.200 --> 07:05.370
of time that this isn't just pure magic right.

07:05.580 --> 07:13.380
You understand that this is source code this is main dot PI that we give to an interpreter that runs

07:13.380 --> 07:19.680
our code line by line and then executes our program.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.370
In this case are what is your name.

07:22.410 --> 07:23.950
Program.

07:24.090 --> 07:27.080
How cool is that.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.670
This is just the beginning.

07:28.710 --> 07:31.730
We're gonna get more and more advanced here.

07:31.930 --> 07:33.830
See if he can play around with this.

07:33.850 --> 07:39.130
We don't know that much about Python yet but I hope this gets you excited because while there's a lot

07:39.130 --> 07:42.020
more coding coming along I'll see in the next one.

07:42.090 --> 07:42.640
Bye bye.
