00:00.180 --> 00:04.100
What is a programming language.

00:04.170 --> 00:07.920
If someone asked you this question can you answer it.

00:09.330 --> 00:13.830
Programming is simply a way for us to give instructions to computers.

00:14.840 --> 00:20.540
We give it an instruction manual and the computer follows without code.

00:20.540 --> 00:23.900
Computer programs wouldn't do anything.

00:23.900 --> 00:27.650
You wouldn't be able to move the mouse around on your screen.

00:27.650 --> 00:33.550
You wouldn't be able to Google things you wouldn't be able to play Pokemon on your phone right.

00:33.560 --> 00:36.920
I can't just tell my computer what to do.

00:36.950 --> 00:43.670
You see computers don't understand English or any other human language for that matter.

00:43.670 --> 00:55.440
So what language do computers speak well they speak in ones and zeros all electronics speak that language

00:55.710 --> 01:04.860
of on or off zero or 1 but writing ones and zeros would be gibberish for us.

01:04.860 --> 01:06.730
It's hard for us to communicate like that.

01:06.780 --> 01:07.060
Right.

01:07.830 --> 01:15.380
So humans have developed programming languages that are in between human language and machine language.

01:15.660 --> 01:23.180
That is zeros and one some programming languages are lower level than others.

01:23.190 --> 01:30.350
That is they're closer to machine language and other programming languages are higher level than others.

01:30.390 --> 01:39.780
That is they're closer to English or a human language and there are lots of programming languages.

01:39.880 --> 01:44.810
You have languages like assembly that is really really close to machine code.

01:44.920 --> 01:51.870
You have languages like Python and javascript that are really really close to English.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.930
That's great.

01:53.930 --> 01:55.000
We have these pieces.

01:55.010 --> 01:58.330
But what are we missing here.

01:58.340 --> 02:05.370
I mean if I want to find flights to Hawaii how do we go from here to.

02:05.390 --> 02:12.530
Well having let's say a Web site show us a display of all our flights telling the computer to show those

02:12.530 --> 02:18.210
flight information on our screen what are we missing here.

02:18.210 --> 02:26.550
Well we have these programming languages that we usually write on a file such as Python javascript maybe

02:26.550 --> 02:27.170
even Java.

02:27.510 --> 02:35.640
And then we somehow need to get these files that we write into ones in zero so that the our machines

02:35.700 --> 02:37.490
can understand.

02:37.660 --> 02:41.300
Well we need a translator right.

02:42.650 --> 02:50.750
We take our code that we write what we call a source code written in a programming languages and we

02:50.750 --> 02:58.000
give that to a translator that can understand that language but also understands machine language.

02:58.190 --> 03:03.500
And this translator just translates these files for us.

03:03.730 --> 03:05.350
So what is this.

03:05.350 --> 03:08.040
TRANSLATOR It's not really a person right.

03:08.050 --> 03:12.610
I'm not giving my code to somebody and somebody is going to just start shouting at the computer and

03:12.730 --> 03:14.670
be quite silly.

03:14.710 --> 03:19.570
What is this translator ready to have your mind blown.

03:19.570 --> 03:30.240
Well it's a nother program written by a human it can either be an interpreter or a compiler.

03:30.360 --> 03:38.190
Now Python usually uses an interpreter usually an interpreter.

03:38.260 --> 03:46.270
Just like a translator goes line by line through our code and executes our code on our machine.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.660
Compilers are a little bit different.

03:50.720 --> 03:59.630
They take your code all at once read the entire file all at once and then translate that to machine

03:59.630 --> 03:59.840
code.

04:00.440 --> 04:09.020
So again interpreter goes line by line and each line executes an instruction a compilers takes the entire

04:09.020 --> 04:12.830
file and turns it into machine code.

04:12.830 --> 04:19.590
Now the differences between these two are a little complicated and beyond the scope of the course.

04:19.730 --> 04:25.070
And don't worry we're going to come back to this topic but I want you to just have this general picture

04:25.460 --> 04:34.630
that when we write code whether it's Python JavaScript Java C or C++ what we're doing is we're typing

04:34.630 --> 04:37.840
it in a language that is human readable.

04:37.840 --> 04:43.690
We're giving it to one of these translators like an interpreter or a compiler.

04:43.870 --> 04:53.310
And these spit out code that are able to run on our machines so to review interpreters translate.

04:53.310 --> 05:01.860
Line by line and execute the line before going to the next line compilers translate all lines of a program

05:02.370 --> 05:11.410
to a file usually called a binary and execute the whole file at once now in the next video we're going

05:11.410 --> 05:16.710
to talk about this process a little bit more in detail especially on how it works with python.

05:17.290 --> 05:19.210
But why did I start with this.

05:19.210 --> 05:21.950
I mean this is a complex topic.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.740
Most developers especially if they're starting out don't even know of this process.

05:26.770 --> 05:29.530
They just know that they write code and then it runs.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.490
So why did I teach this here.

05:32.620 --> 05:40.260
Because in order for us to be able to write Python code well I can't just write it anywhere.

05:40.390 --> 05:48.820
Right if you work right now to your computer and let's say you opened up a text file like this one and

05:48.880 --> 05:54.940
you started typing Python code but for now we don't know Python so let's just say I want to go search

05:55.180 --> 06:04.590
for Pokemon Well this might be code we don't know if it is but I can't just use this right.

06:04.600 --> 06:11.180
I mean this isn't really Python code but how would my computer know what I'm talking about in order

06:11.180 --> 06:14.060
for us to start writing Python.

06:14.090 --> 06:22.060
We need to download this translation service in the next video I'm going to show you how to do that.

06:22.130 --> 06:22.790
I'll see in that one.
