00:01.230 --> 00:02.270
Welcome back.

00:02.280 --> 00:10.170
Let's do our first exercise and this exercise is going to be really easy for you to skip but I do recommend

00:10.170 --> 00:11.760
that you actually do it.

00:11.760 --> 00:17.940
I know it's not coding but it's important because you'll learn that teaching somebody a topic actually

00:17.940 --> 00:18.750
helps you learn.

00:19.560 --> 00:23.380
So this is the exercise based on the videos that you've watched.

00:23.400 --> 00:28.300
How does Python work but don't think about it in your head.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.820
I want you to talk to somebody.

00:29.820 --> 00:33.570
I want you to teach somebody how Python works.

00:33.570 --> 00:40.200
So the first thing you're going to do is go to our community our disco community.

00:40.230 --> 00:42.030
We have lots of people here.

00:42.030 --> 00:48.240
We have about 1500 people online right now plus some alumni plus some star mentors.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.720
Well there's a lot of people.

00:49.950 --> 00:58.510
What I want you to do is go to the programming buddies channel if you haven't already and find a buddy.

00:58.530 --> 01:03.780
And with that buddy whether that person is taking a Python course or taking a javascript course it doesn't

01:03.780 --> 01:11.520
matter to say hey can I spend maybe five minutes teaching you how Python works and see if he can explain

01:11.520 --> 01:14.370
it to them how it works just like you've learned.

01:14.370 --> 01:21.960
And then after you've done that I want you to go find a friend or a family member that has never done

01:21.960 --> 01:28.200
programming before and see if he can explain in simple terms how Python works.

01:28.200 --> 01:34.300
That is how python gets written as source code.

01:34.390 --> 01:43.660
We use this translation service called the interpreter to run this code and then we'll spit out some

01:44.080 --> 01:45.790
instruction for our machines.

01:45.790 --> 01:47.920
I kind of gave away the answer but you know what I mean.

01:47.950 --> 01:54.280
I want you to practice teaching somebody this because by understanding these fundamentals it's going

01:54.280 --> 02:01.180
to help you learn more and more and understand how things work underneath the hood as we get more and

02:01.180 --> 02:02.690
more fast.

02:02.690 --> 02:03.380
All right.

02:03.670 --> 02:05.310
First a little exercise.

02:05.350 --> 02:06.730
It shouldn't be too hard.

02:06.820 --> 02:08.950
I'll see you in the next video by.
