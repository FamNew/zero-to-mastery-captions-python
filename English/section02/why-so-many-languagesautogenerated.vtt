00:01.210 --> 00:01.720
Welcome back.

00:02.440 --> 00:09.010
I wanted to answer this question that I get a lot of even from professional developers that have been

00:09.010 --> 00:10.120
in the field for years.

00:10.120 --> 00:14.100
So I want to tackle this question really quickly right now.

00:14.230 --> 00:16.720
Why are there so many programming languages.

00:16.750 --> 00:21.970
Why can we just have one language that does everything and everybody's happy and we don't have to worry

00:21.970 --> 00:25.880
about learning so many programming languages.

00:25.960 --> 00:33.520
And here's the thing in your career you don't need to know five 10 eight languages now you can be a

00:33.520 --> 00:40.930
really successful developer programmer with just want language just finding that speciality of yours

00:41.770 --> 00:48.220
and programming languages like Python Java and JavaScript offer a lot of opportunities where you don't

00:48.220 --> 00:49.750
need to learn another language.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.620
But why are there so many languages.

00:52.810 --> 00:57.760
If we go to Wikipedia These are the list of programming languages.

00:57.910 --> 01:04.240
And if you're looking through here you should be intimidated because there's no way in your lifetime

01:04.300 --> 01:12.400
you're going to learn all of these and while you won't most likely you're going to learn one two maybe

01:12.400 --> 01:20.870
three languages in your entire lifespan or career as a programmer and different programming languages

01:20.930 --> 01:22.700
are good for different things.

01:22.700 --> 01:27.190
Just like we have different tools to let's say build a house.

01:27.320 --> 01:31.910
You can't just build a house with a hammer you need different tools that are good at different things

01:31.910 --> 01:34.170
to assemble what you want.

01:34.220 --> 01:40.790
So it's impossible to build one ultimate language when we have so many applications so many mobile phones

01:40.790 --> 01:45.200
so many computers so many devices like cameras.

01:45.200 --> 01:52.160
So you have low level languages that we've talked about like assembly code or C and then we have higher

01:52.160 --> 01:55.070
level languages like Python and JavaScript.

01:55.070 --> 02:06.350
Now here's the thing python is usually slower than languages like C++ or C sharp or even Java and we

02:06.350 --> 02:11.030
don't need to get into technical details here but I do want to tell you about a tradeoff.

02:11.420 --> 02:18.140
You see you don't really want to write Python code for low level systems and hardware interactions.

02:18.170 --> 02:22.970
If you're taking this course while you're probably not even interested in that field you see Python

02:23.390 --> 02:29.340
although slower than some languages is good at one thing and does this really really well.

02:29.720 --> 02:38.480
That is developer productivity because python is so easy to learn or at least is very similar to the

02:38.480 --> 02:39.770
English language.

02:40.010 --> 02:45.980
It's become really really popular for developers to be productive and write code really really fast

02:46.010 --> 02:53.870
and less lines than something like C so A print Hello World for example in Python would take while just

02:53.870 --> 02:58.260
one line but all languages have their different strength.

02:58.280 --> 03:02.710
For example if you want to build an app on Android or an OS device.

03:02.990 --> 03:08.600
Well you're not really going to use Python but if you want to do machine learning maybe you want to

03:09.020 --> 03:16.580
build a web server maybe you want to do data visualizations build scripts that process thousands of

03:16.580 --> 03:17.570
Excel files.

03:17.600 --> 03:22.760
Well in that case you're going to use Python and we're going to cover what different things you can

03:22.760 --> 03:25.580
do with Python and what Python is really really good at.

03:25.730 --> 03:29.630
In this course as we explore different projects later on.

03:29.630 --> 03:31.460
But keep that in mind.

03:31.460 --> 03:37.760
The reason there's so many programming languages is that every programming language excels at some things

03:38.090 --> 03:42.190
and while doesn't do so well at others it's all about tradeoff.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.010
There is no ultimate language.

03:44.150 --> 03:49.970
And if a programmer tells you you hate my language is the best language they're probably junior developers

03:49.970 --> 03:51.290
that don't know what they're talking about.

03:51.470 --> 03:56.270
Everything is a pro and con everything has a tradeoff.

03:56.270 --> 04:04.490
And as programmers what really good senior programmers do is being able to detect what these pros and

04:04.490 --> 04:10.760
cons are and what tool to use for a specific problem something that throughout this course I'm going

04:10.760 --> 04:11.960
to try and teach.

04:12.110 --> 04:13.560
I'll see you in the next one.

04:13.760 --> 04:13.950
Bob.
