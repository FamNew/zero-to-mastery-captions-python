00:01.370 --> 00:02.690
Welcome back.

00:02.690 --> 00:11.750
Whenever you start to learn python it's unavoidable that you'll encounter this topic of Python 2 vs.

00:12.020 --> 00:13.850
Python 3.

00:13.850 --> 00:17.390
So what is this all about.

00:17.510 --> 00:19.290
And it's a very important topic.

00:19.610 --> 00:24.410
Now first of all python is created by a human right.

00:24.560 --> 00:28.710
As a matter of fact it was created by this person right here.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.700
His name is Guido.

00:30.870 --> 00:36.050
Now a programming language is always evolving.

00:36.180 --> 00:38.570
It sound like somebody creates a programming language.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.430
It's perfect and that's it.

00:40.440 --> 00:40.770
No.

00:40.830 --> 00:43.680
All programming languages are constantly being updated.

00:43.800 --> 00:51.000
Just like on your phone you constantly get software updates while a programming language is constantly

00:51.000 --> 00:57.660
evolving to make it better and better because nobody gets it right the first time and by the way this

00:57.660 --> 00:59.970
is a great video that I'm going to link to.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.950
You can check it out in the resources.

01:02.160 --> 01:10.350
Now Python was created in 1991 by this gentleman and it was actually created with the name from Monty

01:10.350 --> 01:18.030
Python which was a British comedy group but like I said before the language is always evolving.

01:18.030 --> 01:29.250
And in 2008 Brito decided that while python version 2 which has been used for a very long time had some

01:29.250 --> 01:32.910
things that he and the community wanted to change.

01:33.060 --> 01:41.210
So in 2008 they decided to create Python 3 a new version of the language.

01:41.370 --> 01:43.560
Here was the tricky part.

01:43.560 --> 01:51.600
You see when you update software lets say on your phone or even on your laptop you expect things to

01:51.870 --> 01:54.050
keep working right.

01:54.060 --> 01:55.560
Updates are usually good.

01:55.560 --> 02:03.330
They're improvements but some of the features that Python 2 had they didn't like or they wanted to change

02:03.360 --> 02:03.990
completely.

02:04.140 --> 02:12.150
So Python 3 introduced to what we call breaking changes that is if you updated to Python 3.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.160
Remember the Python interpreter.

02:14.160 --> 02:18.560
The C Python translator that we've been talking about.

02:18.600 --> 02:25.740
Well as soon as you updated that your Python 2 code wasn't really going to work.

02:26.400 --> 02:31.410
It's like updating your phone and then all of a sudden all your apps stop working.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.860
That doesn't sound very good does it.

02:34.880 --> 02:38.360
That's pretty much what happened in 2008.

02:38.360 --> 02:46.010
Most companies that wrote their code in Python Version 2 just kept python version 2 because well for

02:46.010 --> 02:53.390
them to upgrade meant that they had to go through their code line by line and make some changes.

02:53.390 --> 02:56.960
Now these changes weren't that significant.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.770
For example I'll link to some resources but don't worry.

03:00.770 --> 03:06.240
These are topics that we're going to cover throughout the course but different things wouldn't work.

03:06.350 --> 03:12.710
For example the print function which we've learned about in python 2 It didn't have the brackets it

03:12.950 --> 03:15.060
looked like this.

03:15.500 --> 03:19.250
And Python 3 used the brackets.

03:19.580 --> 03:24.090
So all the code that had print like this would break.

03:24.110 --> 03:29.300
Now the differences themselves aren't that big.

03:29.300 --> 03:33.610
I mean you can read through them and we'll talk about this in the course.

03:33.620 --> 03:38.540
But overall you can learn them in a day.

03:38.540 --> 03:44.200
That's why when we learn Python most of the time we're learning Python 3.

03:44.270 --> 03:51.530
But you can use the same knowledge with the older version of Python Now you may see some python version

03:51.530 --> 03:56.060
to code out there for companies that have an upgraded.

03:56.120 --> 04:01.520
But it's now will be called legacy that is come 2020.

04:01.520 --> 04:06.530
It's going to stop receiving security updates so the community Python community as a whole is saying

04:06.530 --> 04:12.860
hey everybody start using Python 3 because we're going to stop maintaining Python 2.

04:13.520 --> 04:18.050
So we're going to learn the most up to date version 3 in this course.

04:18.050 --> 04:25.220
But we're also going to touch on some older topics that Python 2 covers just in case you encounter them

04:25.310 --> 04:32.710
when you work for a company that perhaps still supports legacy code but as I mentioned the whole community

04:32.830 --> 04:35.950
as a whole is moving towards Python 3.

04:35.980 --> 04:43.690
This Web site for example shows you how many big packages popular Python packages which we'll talk about

04:43.990 --> 04:47.320
support Python 3 in our case.

04:47.320 --> 04:52.370
There's only four popular packages that don't support Python 3.

04:52.390 --> 04:55.840
So what I'm saying is Python 3 is the way to go.

04:55.840 --> 04:56.890
It's the way of the future.

04:56.890 --> 04:59.110
That's what we're going to learn in the course.

04:59.110 --> 05:02.960
But I want you to be aware of the historical context.

05:03.280 --> 05:10.090
And one thing to be careful of when in this course you were searching for answers or maybe I have some

05:10.090 --> 05:18.760
exercises that require you to Google things for example if we go to the Python documentation which is

05:18.880 --> 05:28.270
the reference of how well what the programming language does you'll see that you can choose the versions

05:28.270 --> 05:35.680
here and you always want to go with the latest but you might find some answers online that still use

05:35.680 --> 05:37.640
python version too.

05:37.690 --> 05:43.060
So you want to make sure that when you're searching for answers that you don't encounter any legacy

05:43.060 --> 05:44.750
code.

05:44.840 --> 05:50.720
Like I said 95 percent of the time it's mostly the same but you usually want to keep current with the

05:50.720 --> 05:56.720
language it has the most community support most up to date most secure language.

05:57.590 --> 06:05.360
So just a quick note about Python 3 versus Python 2 when you hear the word python.

06:05.360 --> 06:10.770
People are generally just talking about both Python 3 and Python 2.

06:11.020 --> 06:19.540
And if you remember in our repo when we created our first program you see that you're using python version

06:19.630 --> 06:20.870
three point six.

06:20.950 --> 06:24.960
This is the default standard version that rebel control.

06:25.690 --> 06:30.220
So right away we know that we're using Python 3 awesome.

06:30.250 --> 06:31.020
It's up to date.

06:31.030 --> 06:34.210
It's new the whole community is behind it.

06:34.210 --> 06:36.220
Well most of the community is behind it.

06:36.490 --> 06:38.180
So we're all good to go.

06:38.230 --> 06:39.900
I'll see in the next video by.
