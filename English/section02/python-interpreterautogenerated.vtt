WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:02.540
Welcome back.

00:02.540 --> 00:06.040
We just learned what a programming language is.

00:06.110 --> 00:13.700
It's just set of instructions that we give to a translator and this translator can be an interpreter

00:13.970 --> 00:22.220
or compiler and we give these files that we create our own code our source code to these translators

00:22.550 --> 00:28.520
and they allow us to give instructions to machines to computers to phones.

00:28.520 --> 00:35.430
So we learned that we need these machines in order for us to write Python.

00:35.570 --> 00:36.640
Right.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.410
How can we get these.

00:38.450 --> 00:45.980
Well we download them and here we download python from the Python Software Foundation from Python.

00:45.980 --> 00:54.470
Dot org now before we download Python we're going to wait a little bit because in this course I want

00:54.470 --> 01:02.120
you to understand why we're doing things not just follow my tutorials follow my videos and while not

01:02.120 --> 01:08.840
understand the meaning and the fundamentals behind why we're doing things you should be able to teach

01:09.440 --> 01:10.400
why you're going to learn.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.890
So let's take a pause here for a second.

01:13.960 --> 01:20.470
If this is the first time that you're learning a programming language I have some good news for you

01:21.400 --> 01:22.670
at the end of the day.

01:22.810 --> 01:28.450
All programming languages do the same thing and they tell the machine what to do.

01:28.480 --> 01:32.470
However different languages have different ways of doing it.

01:32.500 --> 01:40.660
The beauty is that most languages have very similar principles if this is your first programming language.

01:40.660 --> 01:42.500
Well this is gonna be the hardest part.

01:42.580 --> 01:50.950
Learning the first one afterwards every new language you learn becomes easier and easier in the sense

01:50.950 --> 01:55.110
that it's not the same as let's say learning English and Japanese.

01:55.180 --> 02:02.860
Two very distinct languages in programming things become a lot easier as you learn that first foundational

02:02.920 --> 02:03.990
language.

02:04.000 --> 02:11.650
Now if this is not your first language and let's say you've written code in C C++ or JavaScript and

02:11.680 --> 02:16.800
you just want to learn python well you're going to find these first couple of videos quite easy.

02:16.840 --> 02:21.910
But bear with me trust me we're gonna get into some advanced topics here and we're gonna make you a

02:21.910 --> 02:26.710
full fledged developer by the end of this but let's go back to this topic at hand.

02:26.740 --> 02:30.010
This idea of downloading this translator.

02:30.010 --> 02:37.840
The thing is when people refer to Python the language they're most likely talking about the implementation

02:38.530 --> 02:41.940
that is they're talking not about the language itself.

02:41.950 --> 02:45.610
Because Python the language is just a specification.

02:45.610 --> 02:51.940
You can think of it as a document that somebody wrote that says hey when I write the words D F that

02:51.940 --> 02:58.510
means something in Python and when I write something like print that means something in python.

02:58.510 --> 03:01.230
But the translation machines.

03:01.240 --> 03:10.500
Well we can have tons of them different interpreters different compilers for example Python dawg.

03:10.680 --> 03:15.740
When you click download here you're actually downloading this.

03:16.020 --> 03:21.630
The C Python because it's written in the C programming language.

03:21.750 --> 03:24.720
This is what you're downloading.

03:24.790 --> 03:37.260
It's a program written C to read your python file and well run it on a machine but there's other implementations.

03:37.260 --> 03:45.150
For example there's the GI Thorne project and this is a translator that is written in the Java language

03:46.310 --> 03:51.930
there's pipeline which is actually written in Python.

03:52.050 --> 03:57.070
So it's a interpreter It's a translation machine written in Python.

03:57.360 --> 04:04.260
And then there's also things like irony python which is written for the dot net framework.

04:04.830 --> 04:14.490
So here's a little trick question when you download from Python the official language is actually see

04:14.490 --> 04:15.360
python.

04:15.580 --> 04:23.220
You're downloading this interpreter that follows the python specification but at the end of the day

04:23.220 --> 04:29.900
it's a machine built by somebody but these machines can well come in many forms.

04:29.980 --> 04:38.620
So when most people talk about Python they're talking about this one see Python that well does our translation

04:38.620 --> 04:46.530
for us it interprets our Python code and runs it on a machine.

04:46.530 --> 04:53.420
So we're downloading this and if you want to really get into details as to what we're downloading what

04:53.440 --> 04:58.810
we're downloading a machine that takes our Python code which go hurry we're going to write.

04:59.180 --> 05:08.540
And it goes to the interpreter which we download using C Python and this C Python is going to create

05:08.600 --> 05:18.280
something called a byte code for example this byte code prints hello world on our screen.

05:18.310 --> 05:21.090
Now this might look like gibberish to you.

05:21.190 --> 05:23.550
And even for me I don't know by code.

05:23.710 --> 05:31.200
This looks pretty well confusing just for printing hello world to the screen while the interpreter does

05:31.200 --> 05:32.740
that automatically for us.

05:32.760 --> 05:33.960
We see we don't see it.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.230
It's behind the scene.

05:35.370 --> 05:44.490
Now once it creates a bike code that is closer to machine code it then uses the C Python virtual machine.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.990
Again just something that runs this code.

05:48.090 --> 05:53.390
And then this code gets run on our machine.

05:53.420 --> 05:57.430
Now you're never ever going to be asked this question in an interview.

05:57.440 --> 06:04.130
I mean maybe and most developers don't know this but I want you to use this as a reference that when

06:04.140 --> 06:10.430
we write Python code throughout the rest of this course this is what's happening.

06:10.430 --> 06:12.310
We're writing Python.

06:12.350 --> 06:14.720
It goes gets interpreted.

06:14.750 --> 06:23.570
Line by line and formed into what we call byte code this bike code gets run on the C Python virtual

06:23.570 --> 06:29.570
machine which runs on our computers our phones or laptops.

06:29.570 --> 06:36.560
And when we're downloading from Python dot org we're downloading these two pieces so that once we have

06:36.560 --> 06:40.350
them downloaded we can run python.

06:40.370 --> 06:41.390
All right.

06:41.390 --> 06:44.450
That was a tough one and I mean we just got started.

06:44.450 --> 06:47.370
I hope your brain is an exploding again.

06:47.420 --> 06:49.990
This is something for you to use as a reference.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.240
But you know what.

06:51.260 --> 06:55.410
I think it's time for us to learn how to actually run Python code.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.230
And don't worry we are getting there.

06:57.230 --> 07:01.490
We are going to write our first python program very soon.

07:01.490 --> 07:03.340
I'll see in the next one by.
