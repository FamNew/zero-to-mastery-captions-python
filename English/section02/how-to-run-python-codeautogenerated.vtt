WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:01.320
All right.

00:01.410 --> 00:02.130
Oh man.

00:02.130 --> 00:04.510
We've been talking for a long time.

00:04.620 --> 00:08.240
How can we finally run Python code.

00:08.250 --> 00:09.740
I want to start coding right.

00:09.870 --> 00:12.900
Let's download this translation service right.

00:12.900 --> 00:15.430
Well I'm sorry.

00:15.510 --> 00:20.610
Actually this something we're going to do later on in the course and I know what you're thinking.

00:20.730 --> 00:24.430
W TAF Andre what is this kindergarten.

00:24.540 --> 00:25.550
I mean come on.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.240
I came here to learn python.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.990
Start teaching me python.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.600
And I know I know.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.190
And don't worry.

00:31.200 --> 00:36.840
In this course we're going to get you to have a professional set up with Python so that when you go

00:36.840 --> 00:41.320
into the workforce you are doing what you're supposed to be doing.

00:41.340 --> 00:46.400
We're going to learn how to have all of these setup first.

00:46.470 --> 00:53.660
We're gonna have our terminal or command line where we can run python from right in what we call a repo

00:54.390 --> 01:00.160
and then we're also going to use code editors like Sublime Text and Visual Studio code.

01:00.210 --> 01:07.230
We're also going to use I.D. or integrated developer environments like Pi charm and Spider and we're

01:07.230 --> 01:14.060
also going to use Jupiter notebooks and I'm going to show you how to set up all of these on your computer.

01:14.190 --> 01:20.340
What the pros and cons of using each are and how some of them might be used for machine learning while

01:20.610 --> 01:28.020
others might be used for writing quick scripts and I know this is a lot but it's good to have these

01:28.020 --> 01:34.470
skills depending on what type of job you want and if you're a professional python developer.

01:34.620 --> 01:38.060
Well you should be using most of these but there is a problem.

01:38.070 --> 01:45.120
If I start introducing this in the course right away you see these tools you have to install differently

01:45.150 --> 01:46.980
based on what computer you have.

01:47.460 --> 01:54.090
So if you're using a Mac a Windows a Linux maybe you're using a mobile phone because we want to get

01:54.090 --> 01:59.280
started right away and write some code instead of worrying about installations and making sure that

01:59.280 --> 02:01.580
your computer is all set up.

02:01.590 --> 02:06.570
I want to make sure that all of us can get started right away no matter what device you're on.

02:06.690 --> 02:13.260
Now if you're really really keen head on over to the section where I show you how to install all these

02:13.830 --> 02:15.690
on all of your devices.

02:15.690 --> 02:22.600
So there you have it set up and you can come back to the section but I warn you it's easy to run into

02:22.600 --> 02:26.600
problems and get confused when installing these tools.

02:26.650 --> 02:32.530
So I recommend sticking with what I'm about to show you and I promise we will get you this professional

02:32.530 --> 02:35.860
setup no other course is going to teach you all these things.

02:35.860 --> 02:39.280
But before I dive into these we need to learn.

02:39.410 --> 02:42.580
Well you need to be able to just have fun and write some code.

02:43.120 --> 02:47.860
So what is this trick that I keep mentioning where we don't have to install any of these and still run

02:47.860 --> 02:48.280
Python.

02:48.910 --> 02:50.630
It's called wrap.

02:50.680 --> 03:00.920
You see instead of us having to download this we can go to rappel dot I.T. and when you go here you'll

03:00.930 --> 03:02.700
get a log in screen.

03:02.760 --> 03:09.090
Now I recommend create an account on here because trust me it's going to be very very useful it's one

03:09.090 --> 03:17.580
of my favorite tools and it allows you to save Python files just online for example once you log in

03:17.580 --> 03:18.850
and create an account.

03:18.960 --> 03:25.530
You can just create a new rappel choose the language that you want to use in our case we want to choose

03:25.590 --> 03:36.580
Python we can name our rebel so we can just call it Hey hey we can just create a ripple and check it

03:36.580 --> 03:38.570
out right away.

03:38.830 --> 03:46.780
We have without ever downloading this python translation service we can actually start writing Python

03:47.860 --> 03:54.400
right here in our browsers and this is going to work for anybody that has an Internet connection in

03:54.400 --> 03:59.960
a browser because this interpreter just runs automatically here.

04:00.190 --> 04:05.100
And the beauty with ripple is that well you can save these files.

04:05.110 --> 04:11.380
You can have different folders so as we work through the course you can actually have a folder for all

04:11.380 --> 04:18.190
your python work and just haven't really nice organized file structure that you can access anywhere

04:18.190 --> 04:20.200
you have internet connection.

04:20.200 --> 04:24.480
Now if you don't want to sign up for reptile that is it's completely free.

04:24.670 --> 04:31.630
You can also use this open source glut that I owe which again you go to Python and you're able to run

04:31.870 --> 04:33.980
Python online.

04:34.150 --> 04:42.580
So take your time sign up for reptile that I.T. and let's get started with our first python program.

04:42.590 --> 04:48.290
I'm finally getting there and the next video we're gonna write our first piece of code.

04:48.290 --> 04:49.330
No more waiting.

04:49.340 --> 04:52.340
It's coding time so I'll see you in the next video.

04:52.340 --> 04:52.700
Bye bye.
