00:00.650 --> 00:02.500
Hey they're surprised to see you there.

00:02.590 --> 00:06.620
So we just finished an entire section on Python.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.390
We learned the python language.

00:08.470 --> 00:11.900
We learned the syntax and we can write Python now.

00:11.920 --> 00:12.700
That's awesome.

00:12.700 --> 00:14.570
But here's the thing.

00:14.620 --> 00:17.470
Do you feel ready for the real world.

00:17.470 --> 00:24.960
Do you know what to do with this newfound skill you see when you're first learning a language a really

00:24.960 --> 00:32.070
hard jump is to learn the syntax and the rules of the language and then understanding how you can use

00:32.070 --> 00:37.140
that in the real world to make your life better.

00:37.140 --> 00:46.270
To improve a product to create value for a company that you work for and a lot of developers have this

00:46.420 --> 00:52.760
crossroads that they encounter once they learn their first language and that is what now.

00:52.780 --> 00:54.670
What projects do I build.

00:54.670 --> 00:56.620
How is this useful.

00:56.620 --> 01:02.070
Where can I use Python if you've gotten this far in the course.

01:02.070 --> 01:04.930
This slide should make sense to you by now.

01:04.930 --> 01:12.610
Because if I asked you the question where can you write Python code and have it work.

01:12.610 --> 01:15.640
The answer should be pretty obvious right.

01:15.700 --> 01:24.160
Because if we have a python file or multiple files that is modules and we have a python interpreter

01:24.400 --> 01:33.580
or compiler then by having these two things we can run them anywhere that has a machine that has a computer

01:34.510 --> 01:42.170
we can run it on our own computers our own laptops like we have been throughout the course we can even

01:42.170 --> 01:49.130
run Python code on mobile again as long as we have an interpreter and some Python scripts we can run

01:49.130 --> 01:50.360
those on mobile.

01:50.420 --> 01:55.110
And if you google running Python on mobile you'll see just how to do that.

01:55.250 --> 02:01.760
You can run Python on servers and servers at the end of the day are just computers.

02:01.760 --> 02:10.010
So any computer any machine that understands ones and zeros is able to run Python code as long as we

02:10.010 --> 02:15.280
have these two pieces and this is where the power comes in.

02:15.560 --> 02:25.010
The power is that we now are able to use Python to do the tasks that as humans maybe we're not as good

02:25.010 --> 02:33.930
as machines that is automating things doing things that are really repetitive doing them really fast.

02:33.960 --> 02:42.960
That's why machines are so powerful maybe they're not as creative as humans maybe they can't speak or

02:43.140 --> 02:51.570
write fictional novels but what they're really really good at are calculations simple tasks that they

02:51.570 --> 02:56.440
can do thousands millions billions of times in a matter of seconds.

02:56.640 --> 03:05.880
Something that humans can't do and we use python to help us as humans to be more productive to create

03:05.880 --> 03:14.870
things so that our machines run our Python code and make our lives easier and throughout the next couple

03:14.870 --> 03:18.940
of sections we're going to try and answer that for you.

03:19.050 --> 03:26.460
That is we're going to show you where you can apply Python whether it is to your day to day life whether

03:26.460 --> 03:32.670
it is to work for a company or maybe you want to create your own startup.

03:32.700 --> 03:37.980
We're going to show you how you can apply the knowledge that you've just gained into different projects

03:38.250 --> 03:45.840
your own personal projects for example because this is where Python shot python is one of the most popular

03:45.840 --> 03:50.850
programming languages because it can be applied to lots of things.

03:50.850 --> 03:52.050
How many things.

03:52.050 --> 03:53.790
Well we can do web development.

03:53.790 --> 03:55.260
We can do image processing.

03:55.260 --> 03:57.240
We can send e-mails with Python.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.330
We can even send texts with Python.

03:59.430 --> 04:01.700
We can do machine learning with Python.

04:01.740 --> 04:03.680
We can create our own twitter bots.

04:03.720 --> 04:10.220
We can do data visualization and data analysis we can do something called Data scraping.

04:10.330 --> 04:14.020
We can just do any general scripting with Python.

04:14.020 --> 04:24.310
We can do automation and we can process files like PDX Excel files and many others and we're actually

04:24.310 --> 04:30.110
going to show you and build projects around all of these topics in the upcoming sections.

04:30.170 --> 04:30.400
I know.

04:30.400 --> 04:37.660
Very exciting seems kind of overwhelming but the goal is now that we have the foundation of Python I

04:37.660 --> 04:45.670
want to show you where we can apply this skill so that by the end we have all the tools necessary for

04:45.670 --> 04:54.130
you to dominate the world as a python programmer and have this tool that you can utilize in anything

04:54.280 --> 04:55.650
that you want.

04:55.660 --> 04:58.020
It's a bold statement but it's very exciting.

04:58.150 --> 05:02.560
And I think you're going to really like these next sections let's get started.
