00:00.790 --> 00:03.810
What do I do if I don't have enough experience.

00:03.820 --> 00:07.220
What if I'm underqualified for a job.

00:07.230 --> 00:13.650
Well first of all you should have this mentality mind when applying to jobs and apply to jobs that you

00:13.650 --> 00:16.650
feel you are under qualified for.

00:16.650 --> 00:23.070
If a job is asking you to do something that you already feel confident then you should ask yourself

00:23.430 --> 00:26.290
what am I going to learn in this job.

00:26.340 --> 00:31.620
Am I going to learn actually is this job going to put things on my resume that will make me get better

00:31.920 --> 00:37.530
and get a better position in the future or am I just going to do the same thing that I already know

00:37.530 --> 00:39.950
what to do or how to do it.

00:39.960 --> 00:46.430
Finally you have to keep in mind that job postings are put in order to weed out the weak candidates.

00:47.250 --> 00:54.180
I have seen way too many of these created by non-technical people or just making job sound tougher than

00:54.180 --> 00:59.150
it really is to remove junior developers or engineers from applying.

00:59.160 --> 01:02.550
So ask yourself is this job going to be tough.

01:03.270 --> 01:09.050
Good then that is why you want that's why you should be doing.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.410
Do you feel competent.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.300
You are very qualified for this job.

01:13.350 --> 01:18.440
Okay then maybe you should push yourself and apply to a job that's more difficult than you think.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.740
Every application should be a longshot.

01:20.820 --> 01:24.590
If you're applying to something that you're 100 percent qualified for.

01:24.690 --> 01:26.170
Where is your room to grow.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.910
So dream big.

01:28.140 --> 01:32.870
But in order to dream big you might have a bit of a roadblock.

01:32.910 --> 01:36.630
What if you don't have enough experience.

01:36.640 --> 01:42.140
See I don't love resumes and I don't think a lot of people do either but sometimes without a resume

01:42.180 --> 01:48.000
you cannot get an interview and in order to have a good resumé you need to have something to put on

01:48.000 --> 01:54.760
it like great experience here's the cash so how can you have good experience if you're just getting

01:54.760 --> 01:55.900
started.

01:55.900 --> 02:00.670
It's like you have no hope if you're a beginner or if you don't have enough work experience because

02:00.670 --> 02:03.760
you're just out of school or you're changing careers.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.090
Well not quite.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.990
As with everything there's the regular way of doing things.

02:07.990 --> 02:15.120
Then there's the smart way you see experience doesn't come just from working at another company.

02:15.120 --> 02:19.600
There are many ways that you can demonstrate experience without a past job.

02:19.600 --> 02:23.120
And here you'll find my favorite ways to show improve.

02:23.220 --> 02:24.750
You can get the job done.

02:24.930 --> 02:30.000
You will have to do every single one of them but two out of four of these or even better three out of

02:30.000 --> 02:35.550
four will be greatest showcasing on your resumé and make you stand up.

02:36.420 --> 02:39.830
So let's go in order and see how we can do this.

02:39.840 --> 02:47.510
The first one is get HUB Get hub is a great way to demonstrate that you actually code that you've built

02:47.650 --> 02:49.240
projects.

02:49.310 --> 02:56.600
The number one thing you can do is to start making commits and making sure that you have a good history

02:56.900 --> 02:58.520
of things that you've done.

02:58.610 --> 03:03.230
And by the way if you're wondering how I got this cat picture in here I'll show you a little trick in

03:03.230 --> 03:11.150
the next exercise to make your contribution look a little bit nicer and busier in case you're just getting

03:11.150 --> 03:20.100
started and you don't have a good past history another way to improve your get hub profile or to just

03:20.100 --> 03:25.950
add more experience is contributing and participating in open social projects.

03:25.980 --> 03:34.920
For example I've created a zero to mastery organization where we have a ton of open source projects

03:34.950 --> 03:43.300
by the community that you can contribute to and they're made specifically for you to mess up make mistakes.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.450
Nobody's gonna yell you.

03:44.460 --> 03:46.850
These are just fun projects that are open source.

03:46.860 --> 03:53.580
They can contribute to and you can do as much or as little as you want but this will improve your experience

03:53.610 --> 03:55.680
and contributing to open source projects.

03:55.770 --> 04:01.230
And it's something you can add to your resume is now contributing to open source projects.

04:01.290 --> 04:07.830
Recruiters love seeing this because this demonstrates that you can work with others and also with something

04:07.830 --> 04:10.170
like get hub and version control.

04:10.170 --> 04:15.060
All right let's look at the next one the next one is Web site.

04:15.060 --> 04:20.490
If you especially a full stack or a front end developer or even a designer you should have your own

04:20.540 --> 04:26.840
Web site where you can showcase your skills this again is something you can speak about in your interview

04:27.140 --> 04:28.820
and about how you built the website.

04:28.850 --> 04:32.990
Or it gives you a good way to talk about your past projects.

04:32.990 --> 04:35.480
Now you're asking yourself Andre.

04:35.480 --> 04:38.660
Am I going to have to build a whole new Web site and waste a bunch of time.

04:38.660 --> 04:39.680
Well not really.

04:39.680 --> 04:44.960
Let me show you a couple of tricks you see you don't need to build your own Web site from scratch.

04:44.960 --> 04:48.740
There's a ton of free templates like creative Tim here.

04:48.740 --> 04:57.140
That just gives you a nice template for you to use and fill in with your information we can also look

04:57.140 --> 05:00.140
at this one and again free templates that you can use.

05:00.140 --> 05:05.020
I especially like the mountain template and you can see that.

05:05.060 --> 05:05.570
Yeah.

05:05.720 --> 05:11.540
I mean you can customize this to your own and make it look professional and it's already designed nicely

05:11.540 --> 05:21.900
and also customized for different experiences such as mobile tablet and in a day you can have your own

05:22.160 --> 05:28.700
Web site and just to show you how you shouldn't really spend too much time on your own Web site.

05:28.700 --> 05:32.410
One of my favorite people to follow is Kevin Kelly.

05:32.420 --> 05:35.840
He is very very popular among the tech community.

05:35.850 --> 05:41.840
He is just the overall really smart thinker and you can see his Web site over here.

05:41.870 --> 05:49.650
It's very simple nothing exaggerated very very clean but small very basic layout.

05:50.270 --> 05:57.110
And this is to show you that you don't need some crazy animations make it all flashy to stand out as

05:57.110 --> 05:58.970
long as you have a personal website.

05:58.970 --> 06:04.760
It just shows that you actually spend time building it and doing something that most people wouldn't

06:04.760 --> 06:06.190
do.

06:06.200 --> 06:12.920
Another thing that I want to show you is for example the job or that we have four of my students and

06:12.920 --> 06:16.850
this is again another open source project that the community built.

06:16.850 --> 06:24.200
If we just search through let's say Toronto developers here and we go to Christine a key I hope I'm

06:24.200 --> 06:25.340
saying the last thing right.

06:25.340 --> 06:28.800
You can see how simple yet beautiful her portfolio is.

06:28.820 --> 06:36.110
If we go to about me just a nice little bio with links to her profile if we go to projects we see some

06:36.110 --> 06:43.040
other projects and this is something that she can put on her resumé and immediately stand out from the

06:43.040 --> 06:43.370
crowd.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.940
And it also gives her an opportunity to list projects that she can talk about when she gets to an interview.

06:49.940 --> 06:56.620
All right let's look at the next topic one to two big projects now.

06:56.870 --> 07:03.920
You can't really fake experience if you've never built anything beyond a to do list although or a hello

07:03.920 --> 07:08.360
world app you simply will not be able to get very good jobs.

07:08.360 --> 07:13.770
However most people think having 100 projects is the way to go.

07:13.820 --> 07:21.350
So they do a project today and build small projects many small tiny projects to have 30 of them and

07:21.350 --> 07:26.120
they start building all these projects that are very very simple.

07:26.140 --> 07:28.270
Now that's not actually impressive.

07:28.270 --> 07:31.620
I mean this shows that you're working hard and coding along.

07:31.720 --> 07:38.830
But if I'm a recruiter and show me a project of maybe tic tac toe Well that's I don't really care.

07:38.830 --> 07:43.720
That's something that anybody can build with a bit of coding experience in a day or two.

07:43.780 --> 07:48.970
Frankly no recruiter or interview is going to check out all your 30 projects.

07:48.970 --> 07:53.740
Most of the time we want to hear your most difficult or the hardest.

07:53.740 --> 07:58.910
Biggest project you've worked on instead of spending your time on these small little projects.

07:58.990 --> 08:06.700
Spend your time on one or two big projects for example in other courses that I teach.

08:06.700 --> 08:11.930
We built a face recognition app and this app.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.560
Well it has a front end using reaction yes a back end where we have a restful API server with Express

08:20.040 --> 08:26.950
we've deployed it to Roku we've created session management with authenticated routes.

08:27.180 --> 08:35.740
We store user information such as user name and also hashed passwords securely in our database on post.

08:35.750 --> 08:46.000
Chris we've deployed our app with Docker and we've also used readies for session management and caching.

08:46.200 --> 08:53.310
Now all of that may not mean a lot to you but having something like a one big project they can talk

08:53.310 --> 08:59.370
about all these things will make you sound a lot more impressive than somebody that just built a ton

08:59.370 --> 09:06.490
of tiny projects so focus on that have wanted two big projects that you can show off makes you stand

09:06.490 --> 09:06.870
out.

09:06.910 --> 09:11.030
And it also going to give you something to talk about during the interview.

09:11.140 --> 09:17.350
Put it up on your Web site or create its own Web site and you immediately can put this as the first

09:17.440 --> 09:18.440
item on your resume.

09:19.150 --> 09:20.830
Because here's the thing.

09:20.830 --> 09:23.620
If you don't have work experience.

09:23.710 --> 09:27.150
If we go back to the resume we used in the exercise.

09:27.190 --> 09:28.260
Remember this resume.

09:28.840 --> 09:36.620
Well if you had no work experience maybe for work experience that you can say something like Javascript

09:36.620 --> 09:45.350
developer or web application developer and talk about how you build your project here because to a recruiter

09:45.440 --> 09:51.350
it doesn't really matter if you worked at a certain company building an application or on your own or

09:51.410 --> 09:53.430
that could be a little bit too vague too.

09:53.510 --> 09:59.840
They don't need to know that they just need to know that you build things that are real that are big

09:59.840 --> 10:02.870
and complicated and you solved heart problems.

10:02.900 --> 10:11.210
So having one or two big projects that you can list on your experiences is a great way to add to your

10:11.210 --> 10:11.990
resumé.

10:12.200 --> 10:18.400
If you don't have enough past work experience at companies and I have a few students who have actually

10:18.400 --> 10:26.320
used this technique to get interviews even though they just learn how to code six months ago and then

10:26.320 --> 10:30.780
finally we have the blog post or blog.

10:31.150 --> 10:33.710
Let's have a look at what I mean by that.

10:33.780 --> 10:36.300
This is another thing you can include in your resume.

10:37.200 --> 10:42.220
Especially if it's related to a technology you're using or the company is using.

10:42.300 --> 10:50.550
For example I have here my medium profile and medium com allows anybody around the world to just post

10:51.240 --> 10:54.570
a blog post and it's very popular with the tech community.

10:54.570 --> 10:58.730
So there's a lot of tech related posts they can write on medium.

10:58.740 --> 11:00.610
And there's other platforms like this.

11:00.660 --> 11:07.350
What if you wrote a blog post about a specific technology that the company you're applying for is using

11:08.440 --> 11:11.240
or some sort of a technical problem that they're facing.

11:11.440 --> 11:18.580
By doing that and just adding a link to that blog post it gives you again another leg up to most people

11:19.720 --> 11:26.320
and the great thing about platforms like this is that well if we go to one of my articles here you can

11:26.490 --> 11:31.840
post it to what we call publishers and publishers allow your post to be discovered by others.

11:32.020 --> 11:33.460
And it's very simple to do.

11:33.460 --> 11:39.250
You can write a blog post on Medium in a day and submit it to a place like Hacker noon and lots of people

11:39.250 --> 11:39.600
see it.

11:40.030 --> 11:48.550
And as soon as you show this to a recruiter or an interviewer again it automatically shows that you

11:48.550 --> 11:49.720
know what you're talking about.

11:49.720 --> 11:54.300
Or at least it makes you stand out from the rest and you can do this with YouTube videos as well.

11:54.330 --> 11:56.850
But I prefer writing because it's a lot faster.

11:56.860 --> 12:01.590
And it looks a lot more professional so let's just review here.

12:01.710 --> 12:05.060
What happens if you don't have enough experience.

12:05.070 --> 12:10.980
Well all of these four points allow you to gain that experience or show that you have experience without

12:11.670 --> 12:15.420
actually having traditional work experience.

12:15.420 --> 12:21.330
All you need to do is start something on your own and build something like a project or a portfolio

12:21.360 --> 12:23.580
or a blog post.

12:23.580 --> 12:29.490
This only shows initiative but you can focus this project on solely getting your interviews or you can

12:29.490 --> 12:37.510
participate in a hackathon or contribute to open source projects by taking this initiative you're doing

12:37.510 --> 12:43.500
more than most people that hoped to just land an interview by sending a generic resume.

12:43.960 --> 12:47.980
You'll immediately stand out from the crowd and give you something to put on your resume.

12:47.980 --> 12:52.710
That again is different than the average developer.

12:52.770 --> 12:59.610
Plus you have the added benefit of something to talk about in your actual interview remember.

12:59.710 --> 13:01.670
Nothing is given to you for free.

13:02.390 --> 13:06.020
And luck is for those who rather wait than go after what they want.

13:06.020 --> 13:13.520
So by simply building something just for fun such as a side project you're showing how self-motivated

13:13.540 --> 13:15.260
and ambitious you are.

13:15.290 --> 13:18.470
Experience doesn't mean on the job experience.

13:18.500 --> 13:24.410
Write about your portfolio projects maybe talk about your website and how you built it.

13:24.410 --> 13:26.000
Talk about your GitHub profile.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.020
Maybe a hackathon you participate in and or open source projects you've worked on.

13:31.040 --> 13:37.940
Write a blog post on a specific technology that the company you're applying to is using all of them.

13:37.940 --> 13:38.960
Answer this question.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.980
Do you have experience.

13:41.130 --> 13:47.280
Finally there are many things that you can add that are not developer related but can make you a great

13:47.280 --> 13:48.060
employee.

13:48.060 --> 13:51.670
For example did you work as an instructor at a camp.

13:51.750 --> 13:57.110
Well you can now add ability to manage people and communicate well with others.

13:57.130 --> 14:02.030
Any skill that is related to getting the job done can be included.

14:02.120 --> 14:08.450
Also if you have only had six months of coding experience don't show that on the resume.

14:08.450 --> 14:16.720
That doesn't mean to lie but to hide that information because a recruiter only glances at your resume.

14:16.730 --> 14:21.140
They won't care if you're the best of all or in the world if they just see six months experience that's

14:21.140 --> 14:22.490
too risky for them.

14:22.640 --> 14:26.720
Your resumé will most likely be discarded no matter how good of a developer you are.

14:26.750 --> 14:34.280
So remember resume is only good to get your foot in the door by tweaking your resume to show that you

14:34.280 --> 14:40.430
have experience so that the recruiters thinks oh interviewing this person is low risk because they know

14:40.430 --> 14:43.100
what they're talking about is a good way of doing it.

14:44.430 --> 14:50.080
Do you have past experience having made good decisions in the past and have you worked on a challenging

14:50.080 --> 14:51.710
problem and solve them.

14:51.760 --> 14:58.570
If you're able to answer yes to that well then a recruiter is most likely going to ask you for an interview.

14:59.740 --> 15:00.670
I'll see you in the next video.
