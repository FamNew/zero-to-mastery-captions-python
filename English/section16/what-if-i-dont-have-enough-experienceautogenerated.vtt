00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.810
"What do I do if I don't have enough experience?"
"What if I'm underqualified for a job?"

00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:12.187
Well, first of all, you should have this
mentality in mind when applying to jobs

00:00:12.288 --> 00:00:16.188
and apply to jobs that you feel
you are under qualified for.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.670
If a job is asking you to do something
that you already feel confident

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.020
then you should ask yourself "What
am I going to learn in this job?".

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.650
"Am I going to learn actually, is this job going to
put things on my resume that will make me get better

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.889
and get a better position in the future?

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.940
Or am I just going to do the same thing that
I already know what to do or how to do it?"

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.190
Finally, you have to keep in mind that job postings
are put in order to weed out the weak candidates.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.179
I have seen way too many of these created by non-technical
people or just making job sound tougher than

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.830
it really is to remove junior
developers or engineers from applying.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.160
So ask yourself:
"Is this job going to be tough?"

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.590
Good, then

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.100
that is what you want. That's
why you should be doing.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.440
Do you feel competent?

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.940
You are very qualified for this job.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.410
Ok then, maybe you should push yourself and apply
to a job that's more difficult than you think.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.650
Every application should be a long shot. If you're applying
to something that you're 100 percent qualified for

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.220
where is your room to grow?

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.890
So dream big.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.860
But in order to dream big,
you might have a bit of a roadblock.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.750
What if you don't have enough experience?

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.540
See, I don't love resumes and I don't
think a lot of people do either.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.050
But sometimes without a resume you cannot get an
interview. And in order to have a good resume

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.990
you need to have something to put on
it, like great experience.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.870
Here's the catch though: "How can you have good
experience if you're just getting started?"

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.639
It's like you have no hope if you're a beginner or
if you don't have enough work experience because

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.760
you're just out of school
or you're changing careers.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.040
Well not quite.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.990
As with everything there's the
regular way of doing things

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.150
then there's the smart way.

00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:15.135
You see experience doesn't come just
from working at another company.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.430
There are many ways that you can
demonstrate experience without a past job.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.050
And here you'll find my
favorite ways to show improve.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.930
You can get the job done.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.960
You won't have to do
every single one of them.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.579
But two out of four of
these or even better

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.990
three out of four, will be great at showcasing
on your resume and make you stand up.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.820
So let's go in order and
see how we can do this.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.010
The first one is GitHub.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.300
GitHub is a great way to demonstrate that you
actually code that you've built projects.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.620
The number one thing you can do is to start making
commits and making sure that you have a good history

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.460
of things that you've done.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.249
And by the way if you're wondering how I got this
cat picture in here I'll show you a little trick in

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.989
the next exercise to make your contribution
look a little bit nicer and busier.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:17.940
In case you're just getting started and you don't
have a good past history. Another way to improve your

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.990
GitHub profile or to just add more experience is
contributing and participating in open source projects.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:34.949
For example I've created a zero to mastery organization
where we have a ton of open source projects

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:43.309
by the community that you can contribute to and they're
made specifically for you to mess up, make mistakes.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.489
Nobody is going to yell you.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.979
These are just fun projects that are open source that
you can contribute to and you can do as much or as

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.855
little as you want but this will improve your
experience and contributing to open source projects and

00:03:55.856 --> 00:04:01.270
it's something you can add to your resumes.
Now, contributing to open source projects

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.829
recruiters love seeing this because this demonstrates
you can work with others and also with something

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.110
like GitHub and version control.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.650
All right let's look at the next one.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.940
The next one is website.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.490
If you are especially a full-stack or front-end
developer or even a designer you should have your own

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.850
website where you can showcase your skills.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.899
This again is something you can speak about in your
interview and about how you built the website or it gives

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.980
you a good way to talk
about your past projects.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.089
Now you're asking yourself: "Ah! Andrei, am I going to
have to build a whole new website and waste a bunch

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.650
of time?"

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.679
Well not really.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.910
Let me show you a couple of tricks. You see you
don't need to build your own website from scratch.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.049
There's a ton of free templates like creative tim
here that just gives you a nice template for you

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:58.010
to use and fill in with your information.
We can also look at this one.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.130
And again free templates that you can use.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.610
I especially like the mountain
template and you can see that, yeah!

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.510
I mean you can customize this to your own and make it
look professional and it's already designed nicely

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:21.900
and also customized for different experiences such
as mobile, tablet and in a day you can have your own

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.450
website.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.680
And just to show you how you shouldn't really
spend too much time on your own website.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.390
One of my favorite people
to follow is Kevin Kelly.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:38.780
He is very very popular among the tech community
and he's just overall really smart thinker.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.860
And you can see his website over here.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.550
It's very simple.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.860
Nothing exaggerated.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.670
A very very clean but
small very basic layout.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.430
And this is to show you that you
don't need some crazy animations.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.939
Make it all flashy to stand out.
As long as you have a personal website

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:05.190
it just shows that you actually spend time building
it and doing something that most people wouldn't do.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:12.610
Another thing that I want to show you is for example
the jobboard that we have for all of my students

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.680
and this is again another open source
project that the community built.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:24.199
If we just search through let's say Toronto developers
here and we go to Christine Aqui I hope I'm

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.280
saying the last thing right.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.790
You can see how simple yet
beautiful her portfolio is.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:36.109
If we go to about me just a nice little bio with links
to her profile if we go to projects we see some

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.220
other projects.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.650
And this is something that she can put on her
resume and immediately stand out from the crowd.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.909
And it also gives her an opportunity to list projects
that she can talk about when she gets to an interview.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.590
All right let's look at the next topic.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.520
1 ~ 2 big projects. Now

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:04.800
you can't really fake experience. If you've never built
anything beyond a "to-do list" or a "Hello World" app

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.300
you simply will not be
able to get very good jobs.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.730
However, most people think having a
hundred projects is the way to go.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:21.349
So they do a project today and build small projects
many small tiny projects to have 30 of them and

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.490
they start building all these
projects that are very very simple.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.269
Now that's not actually impressive.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.680
I mean it shows that you're
working hard and coding along.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:39.009
But if I'm a recruiter you can show me a project of
maybe "tic-tac-toe" but I don't really care that's

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.740
something that anybody can build with a
bit of coding experience in a day or two.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:49.860
Frankly no recruiter or interviewer is going to
check out all your 30 projects. Most of the time

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.709
we want to hear your most
difficult or the hardest

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.850
biggest project you've worked on. Instead of
spending your time on these small little projects

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:06.720
spend your time on one or two big projects.
For example; in other course that I teach

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:13.250
we built a face recognition app.
And this app, well has a front end

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:21.570
using React.js, a backend where we have a RESTful API
server with Express. We've deployed it to Heroku.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:32.010
We've created session management with authenticator
routes, we store user information such as username.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:37.019
And also hashed passwords securely
in our database on Postgres.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:46.180
We've deployed our app with Docker and we've also
used redis for session management and caching.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:53.309
Now all of that may not mean a lot to you but having
something like a one big project they can talk

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:59.369
about all these things, will make you sound a lot
more impressive than somebody that just built a ton

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:06.860
of tiny projects. So focus on that have 1 to 2 big
projects that you can show off makes you stand out.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:12.340
And it's also going to give you something to talk about
during the interview and put it up on your website

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:19.510
or create its own website and you immediately can
put this as the first item on your resume. Because

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.679
here's the thing; if you
don't have work experience

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.030
if we go back to the resume
we used in the exercise.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.590
Remember this resume.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:36.619
Well if you have no work experience, maybe for work
experience you can say something like javascript

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:42.840
developer or web application developer and
talk about how you build your project here.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:50.060
Because to a recruiter it doesn't really matter if you
worked at a certain company building an application

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.539
or on your own or that could
be a little bit vague too.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.790
They don't need to know that.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:01.609
They just need to know that you build things that are
real that are big and complicated and you solved

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.929
hard problems.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:11.209
So having one or two big projects they you can list
on your experiences, is a great way to add to your

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:16.350
resume if you don't have enough
past work experience at companies.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:22.779
And I have a few students who have actually used this
technique to get interviews, even though they just

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.820
learn how to code

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:31.149
six months ago. And then finally
we have the blog posts or blog.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.760
Let's have a look at what I mean by that.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:39.479
This is another thing you can include in your resume,
especially if it's related to a technology you're

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.410
using or the company is using.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:50.550
For example I have here my medium profile. medium.com
allows anybody around the world to just post

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:57.810
a blog post and it's very popular with the tech
community so there's a lot of tech related posts that

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.610
you right on medium and there's
other platforms like this.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:07.350
What if you wrote a blog post about a specific
technology that the company you're applying for is using

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:15.400
or some sort of a technical problem that they're facing?
By doing that and just adding a link to that blog post.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.750
It gives you again another
leg up to most people.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:26.350
And the great thing about platforms like this is that
well if we go to one of my articles here you can

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.850
post it to what we call publishers and publishers
allow your post to be discovered by others.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.459
And it's very simple to do.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:39.279
You can write a blog post on medium in a day and submit
it to a place like hackernoon and lots of people

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:48.040
see it. And as soon as you show this to a recruiter
or an interviewer, again it automatically shows that

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:53.049
you know what you're talking about or at least it
makes you stand out from the rest. And you can do this

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.320
with YouTube videos as well.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:59.820
But I prefer writing because it's a lot
faster and it looks a lot more professional.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:05.030
So let's just review here; "what happens
if you don't have enough experience?"

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.980
Well all of these four points allow you to gain that
experience or show that you have experience without

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:15.060
actually having traditional
work experience.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:21.360
All you need to do is start something on your own
and build something like a project or a portfolio

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.550
or a blog post.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:29.000
This only shows initiative but you can focus
this project on solely getting your interviews.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:37.029
Or you can participate in a hackathon or contribute
to open source projects. By taking this initiative

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:43.950
you're doing more than most people that hope to
just land an interview by sending a generic resume.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.640
You'll immediately stand out from the crowd and
give you something to put on your resume that again

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.080
is different than the average developer.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.950
Plus you have the added benefit of something
to talk about in your actual interview.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:05.779
Remember nothing is given to you for free and luck
is for those who rather wait and go after what they

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:11.310
want so by simply building something
just for fun such as a side project.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.289
You're showing how self-motivated
and ambitious you are.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.480
Experience doesn't mean
on the job experience.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.370
Write about your portfolio projects.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.409
Maybe talk about your
website and how you built it.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:29.719
Talk about your GitHub profile maybe a hackathon you
participate in and or open source projects you've

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.069
worked on.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:37.909
Write a blog post on a specific technology that the
company you're applying to is using. All of them

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.970
answer this question:
"Do you have experience?"

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:48.059
Finally there are many things that you can add that are
not developer related, but can make you a great employee.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.420
For example, "did you work
as an instructor at a camp?"

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:57.070
Well you can now add ability to manage
people and communicate well with others.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.310
Any skill that is related to getting
the job done can be included.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:08.400
Also if you have only had six months of coding
experience, don't show that on the resume.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:16.550
That doesn't mean to lie but to hide that information.
Because a recruiter only glances at your resume.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.740
They won't care if you're the best developer in
the world if they just see six months experience.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.669
That's too risky for them.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.730
Your resume will most likely be discarded
no matter how good of a developer you are.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:34.129
So remember resumes are only good to get your foot
in the door. By tweaking your resume to show that

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:40.279
you have experience so that the recruiter thinks "Oh
interviewing this person is low risk because they

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.380
know what they're talking about",
is a good way of doing it.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.079
"Do you have past experience?
Have you made good decisions in the past?

00:14:48.103 --> 00:14:51.740
And have you worked on a challenging
problem and solve them?"

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.710
If you're able to answer yes to that

00:14:53.734 --> 00:14:59.274
well then a recruiter is most likely
going to ask you for an interview.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:00.980
I'll see you in the next video.
