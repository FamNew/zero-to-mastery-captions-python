00:00.550 --> 00:01.920
Hey you're still around.

00:01.930 --> 00:03.380
That's good news.

00:03.580 --> 00:09.910
Now many of you might be wondering if I'd become a python developer.

00:09.970 --> 00:14.850
What can I do with my career and you know one python.

00:15.260 --> 00:24.950
I think besides maybe javascript offers some of the best opportunities for employment and options for

00:24.950 --> 00:28.260
different ways that you can go in your career.

00:28.340 --> 00:35.270
For example you might want to become a software engineer a software engineer is a person that built

00:35.270 --> 00:41.270
software built programs and code to solve real world problems.

00:41.270 --> 00:49.250
If you want to work for a company like Google Amazon Facebook Netflix you might apply to become a software

00:49.250 --> 00:56.540
engineer and use python in your coding interviews to solve coding problems and get in those big companies

00:57.290 --> 00:59.780
or you might want to apply for a job.

00:59.780 --> 01:01.520
That's a python developer.

01:01.520 --> 01:08.030
That's a very generic term but a python developer is essentially somebody that solves problems that

01:08.030 --> 01:12.430
a company has with Python so it can be many different things.

01:13.960 --> 01:23.290
Or maybe you are a research analyst and I have a friend who has a P.H. team microbiology and he uses

01:23.290 --> 01:33.430
python because he analyzes data that his lab gets with Python or you might want to be a data analyst

01:33.820 --> 01:36.590
that is similar to research analyst.

01:36.670 --> 01:43.350
They use whatever data that a company has and analyze it to make business decisions.

01:43.420 --> 01:50.770
Again we can use python to analyze these things or you might want to become a data scientist.

01:50.880 --> 01:55.470
You can think of a data scientist as a level up from a data analyst.

01:55.470 --> 02:03.120
They can do what most data analysts do but they also have really strong mathematical statistical programming

02:03.120 --> 02:12.810
backgrounds in order to create algorithms and study data in order to create perhaps new models or there's

02:12.840 --> 02:20.760
even a back and developer or a web developer that works on building for example API services.

02:20.760 --> 02:28.440
You can use tools like Django and flask things we'll talk about in this course to build web applications

02:28.920 --> 02:37.140
or you might want to do testing and automation testing and automation can be as simple as testing a

02:37.140 --> 02:45.180
Web site or a web app or it can be testing a mobile application and writing scripts to simulate to user

02:45.180 --> 02:53.790
behaviors and tests that a company's product works and of course a really popular one right now is machine

02:53.790 --> 03:02.760
learning creating machine learning models from lots and lots of data to create these models that can

03:02.820 --> 03:07.460
predict or perhaps create something useful for a company.

03:07.470 --> 03:13.590
The options are almost endless and it can be overwhelming if you're just starting out.

03:13.590 --> 03:19.830
Luckily for you in this course we're actually going to touch on each one of these topics and in our

03:20.190 --> 03:26.130
over 10 projects that we're going to build we're going to experience what each one of these roles might

03:26.130 --> 03:32.880
do so that at the end of the course if you find something that piques your interest well you can pursue

03:32.880 --> 03:33.830
it further.

03:33.930 --> 03:40.020
But this way we get to dip our toes in each one of these careers and see what you might like.

03:40.170 --> 03:48.460
While you might find interesting but the beauty is that by learning Python it opens up a whole world

03:48.460 --> 03:56.940
of possibilities possibilities of a really good career because it is a very valuable skill.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.650
All right I hope you're excited.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.440
You're down a good path.

04:00.670 --> 04:02.160
I'll see you in the next video.

04:02.160 --> 04:02.560
Bye bye.
