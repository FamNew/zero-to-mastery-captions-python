00:00.600 --> 00:04.260
Hello I'm super excited to start this course with you.

00:04.320 --> 00:09.510
But before we do we need to see where we're starting and where we're ending up.

00:09.870 --> 00:12.210
So we have a clear path to success.

00:12.420 --> 00:19.770
Now this course has over 200 HD videos and tons of exercises and projects but they're all broken down

00:19.770 --> 00:23.010
into sections to help us learn better.

00:23.010 --> 00:27.310
The course is going to start off with Python basics in here.

00:27.360 --> 00:32.730
If this is your first time learning a programming language it's going to be super super helpful even

00:32.730 --> 00:37.770
for those that know a programming language already but don't know anything about python.

00:37.770 --> 00:44.040
This section is gonna get you caught up to speed with the basics so that you feel comfortable programming.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.330
This is a big section.

00:45.510 --> 00:52.320
So we actually have two parts and along the way you're gonna watch me code but also code yourself and

00:52.320 --> 00:57.330
practice coding so that you get comfortable with what Python has to offer.

00:57.390 --> 01:01.630
Next we talk about a professional python developer environment.

01:01.710 --> 01:07.530
We teach you how to use the terminal and the command line about using code editors like Sublime Text

01:07.530 --> 01:09.140
and Visual Studio code.

01:09.150 --> 01:11.110
We talk about using pi charm.

01:11.190 --> 01:18.170
A fully integrated idea for Python developers and also how to use Jupiter notebooks because we're gonna

01:18.210 --> 01:22.710
use these notebooks later on in the course to do something really really exciting.

01:22.710 --> 01:24.540
Hint hint it's machine learning.

01:24.540 --> 01:32.040
And once we have a fully professional developer environment we then get into some advanced Python topics.

01:32.040 --> 01:36.780
Now this section we're not going to shy away from any tough topics but I'm gonna help you understand

01:36.780 --> 01:38.500
them and make sense of it all.

01:38.520 --> 01:45.270
We're going to talk about classes object oriented programming about decorators generators air handling

01:45.330 --> 01:51.740
functional programming as well as best practices when it comes to how to write clean code.

01:52.050 --> 01:58.650
And we'll also learn about popular Python packages how to work with files how to test our code how to

01:58.650 --> 02:01.520
use regular expressions and so much more.

02:01.590 --> 02:05.320
You're ahead my hurt by the end of this section but trust me it's going to be fun.

02:05.550 --> 02:08.100
Now most courses will be done by then.

02:08.220 --> 02:12.420
You've learned python and you should be all set right.

02:12.420 --> 02:19.560
Well not really because once we've learned this new language this new syntax we have our computers set

02:19.560 --> 02:21.030
up to work with Python.

02:21.060 --> 02:24.570
We need to talk about how we can apply our newfound knowledge.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.710
This is the fun part of the course.

02:26.910 --> 02:30.710
We start talking about the careers and the career options you have in Python.

02:30.990 --> 02:34.180
Then we get into different fields that we can use python.

02:34.380 --> 02:40.260
We're going to learn about scripting in Python where we use python to send automated emails.

02:40.260 --> 02:47.970
We use python to process images work with PDA files we use python to send ourselves text messages.

02:47.970 --> 02:54.870
We build a Twitter bot and my favorite project in this section is we build a password checker to actually

02:54.870 --> 02:58.580
see if the passwords that you use have ever been hacked.

02:58.590 --> 03:00.350
It's a really really fun one.

03:00.360 --> 03:08.430
We also talk about data scraping a very common use case with python is to scrape data from online and

03:08.430 --> 03:10.180
use it for something productive.

03:10.230 --> 03:15.750
In our case we're going to learn about data scraping and how we can scrape a really popular Web site

03:15.750 --> 03:22.350
for programmers to only select the articles that are important for you to stay up to date with the industry.

03:22.350 --> 03:24.510
Again it's gonna be a really fun project.

03:24.510 --> 03:27.760
I know I'm saying all projects are fun but OK I'm biased.

03:27.780 --> 03:28.940
Give me a break here.

03:28.950 --> 03:34.230
We're also going to learn about automation and we're going to use something called selenium to actually

03:34.230 --> 03:36.570
control through our machines.

03:36.570 --> 03:43.170
A web browser and get the machine to do different tasks as if it's a user and there's some really fun

03:43.170 --> 03:46.400
applications when it comes to automation that we'll talk about.

03:46.530 --> 03:53.400
And then I know I know everybody's two favorite topics web development and data science and machine

03:53.400 --> 03:54.340
learning.

03:54.510 --> 04:00.090
These two sections are gonna be a ton of fun and I think are going to probably be the most popular sections

04:00.270 --> 04:01.550
in the web development section.

04:01.560 --> 04:10.050
We're going to learn how to use HCM l CSF and JavaScript as well as Python to build our own server build

04:10.110 --> 04:17.490
our own portfolio Web site put the Web site online in production and have future employers and customers

04:17.580 --> 04:19.340
message you through your Web site.

04:19.620 --> 04:24.600
And yes you're gonna get to customize it and do whatever you want to this portfolio Web site so you

04:24.600 --> 04:26.960
have something to show for it at the end of the course.

04:27.120 --> 04:32.280
And then the machine learning data science part we're going to use something called Jupiter notebooks

04:32.640 --> 04:36.770
and Kaggle to access some really interesting datasets.

04:36.840 --> 04:42.500
We're going to use libraries like pandas and psychic learn to predict which soccer players are going

04:42.500 --> 04:45.650
to be the most valuable or are underpaid.

04:45.750 --> 04:51.660
We're going to build our own machine learning model using the iris dataset and then we're also going

04:51.660 --> 04:57.930
to do some image detection where we can feed the machine learning model an image and it's going to predict

04:57.960 --> 05:04.970
what the image is of and you're actually going to see how this magic of machine learning works underneath

05:04.970 --> 05:09.030
the hood as you can see we have a ton to cover in this course.

05:09.140 --> 05:14.510
And by the end of it all this is all going to fit in together and makes sense from the very beginning

05:14.570 --> 05:18.300
of Python basics to the very end with machine learning.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.230
We're going to take you from zero to mastery.

05:21.230 --> 05:21.960
But you know what.

05:22.010 --> 05:25.660
The best part of this course is our online community.

05:25.670 --> 05:31.550
We have thousands of developers chatting every day helping each other out solving problems together

05:31.820 --> 05:35.240
and just talking about the latest and greatest in programming.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.760
Now this is an optional resource for you to use.

05:37.790 --> 05:41.990
So you can have back and forth conversations with other students and myself.

05:41.990 --> 05:45.860
So you feel like you're part of a classroom and you're not doing this all along.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.230
But you know what.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.160
Enough talk.

05:48.170 --> 05:49.460
I know you're getting excited.

05:49.460 --> 05:50.210
I am too.

05:50.210 --> 05:51.480
So let's get started.

05:51.500 --> 05:56.750
Let's start learning and see why Python has become the most popular language in the world.
