00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.260
Helllooo! I'm super excited
to start this course with you.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.510
But before we do, we need to see where
we're starting and where we're ending up...

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.210
...so we have a clear path to success.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.369
Now this course has over 200 HD videos
and tons of exercises and projects.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.009
But they're all broken down into
sections to help us learn better.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.610
The course is going to start
off with Python basics.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.230
In here, if this is your first time
learning a programming language...

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:32.254
...it's going to be super super helpful...

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.769
...even for those that know a programming language
already but don't know anything about Python...

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.039
...this section is gonna get you caught up to speed with
the basics so that you feel comfortable programming.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.330
This is a big section.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.420
So we actually have two parts...

00:00:47.444 --> 00:00:52.044
...and along the way you're gonna
watch me code but also code yourself...

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.330
...and practice coding so that you get
comfortable with what Python has to offer.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.630
Next, we talk about a professional
Python developer environment.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.730
We teach you how to use the
terminal and the command line...

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.140
...about using code editors like
Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.110
We talk about using PyCharm...

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.270
...a fully integrated IDE for Python developers
and also how to use Jupiter notebooks...

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.310
...because we're gonna use these notebooks later on
in the course to do something really really exciting.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.440
Hint hint, it's machine learning.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.640
And once we have a fully
professional developer environment...

00:01:28.664 --> 00:01:31.964
...we then get into some
advanced Python topics.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.579
Now this section we're not going
to shy away from any tough topics.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.500
But I'm gonna help you understand
them and make sense of it all.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.770
We're going to talk about classes,
object oriented programming...

00:01:41.794 --> 00:01:46.894
...about decorators, generators,
air handling, functional programming...

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.040
...as well as best practices
when it comes to how to write clean code.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.550
And we'll also learn about
popular Python packages.

00:01:55.574 --> 00:02:01.520
How to work with files, how to test our code,
how to use regular expressions and so much more.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.320
You're ahead my hurt by the end of this
section but trust me it's going to be fun.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.100
Now most courses will be done by then.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.419
You've learned python and
you should be all set, right?

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.560
Well, not really...

00:02:13.584 --> 00:02:19.484
...because once we've learned this new language,
this new syntax we have our computers set...

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.030
...up to work with Python.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.570
We need to talk about how we
can apply our newfound knowledge.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.710
This is the fun part of the course.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.710
We start talking about the careers and
the career options you have in Python.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.180
Then we get into different fields
that we can use Python.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.760
We're going to learn
about scripting in Python...

00:02:36.784 --> 00:02:39.984
...where we use Python
to send automated emails.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.370
We use Python to process images.

00:02:43.372 --> 00:02:47.870
Work with PDF files we use Python
to send ourselves text messages.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.970
We build a Twitter bot
and my favorite project in this section...

00:02:51.994 --> 00:02:58.580
...is we build a password checker to actually see
if the passwords that you use have ever been hacked.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.350
It's a really really fun one.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.730
We also talk about data scraping.

00:03:02.754 --> 00:03:08.354
A very common use case with Python
is to scrape data from online and...

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.180
...use it for something productive.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.750
In our case we're going to
learn about data scraping...

00:03:12.774 --> 00:03:16.374
...and how we can scrape a really
popular website for programmers...

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.349
...to only select the articles that are important
for you to stay up to date with the industry.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.509
Again it's gonna be a really fun project.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.760
I know I'm saying all projects
are fun but OK I'm biased.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.940
Give me a break here.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.230
We're also going to
learn about automation...

00:03:31.254 --> 00:03:34.229
...and we're going to use something
called Selenium to actually...

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.569
...control through our machines...

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.270
...a web browser and get the
machine to do different tasks...

00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:43.594
...as if it's a user and there's
some really fun applications...

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.500
...when it comes to
automation that we'll talk about.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.100
And then I know I know
everybody's two favorite topics...

00:03:50.124 --> 00:03:54.340
...web development and data science
and machine learning.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.490
These two sections are
gonna be a ton of fun.

00:03:57.514 --> 00:04:00.034
And I think are going to probably
be the most popular sections.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.550
In the web development section...

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.450
We're going to learn how to use HTML,
CSS and JavaScript...

00:04:06.474 --> 00:04:09.674
...as well as Python to
build our own server...

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.490
...build our own portfolio website...

00:04:12.514 --> 00:04:17.514
...put the website online in production
and have future employers and customers...

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.340
...message you through your website.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.800
And yes you're gonna get to customize it...

00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:24.599
...and do whatever you want
to this portfolio website so you...

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.960
...have something to show
for it at the end of the course.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.080
And then the machine
learning data science part.

00:04:30.104 --> 00:04:32.604
We're going to use something
called Jupiter notebooks...

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.770
...and Kaggle to access some
really interesting datasets.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.000
We're going to use libraries
like pandas and Scikit-Learn...

00:04:40.024 --> 00:04:45.650
...to predict which soccer players are going
to be the most valuable or are underpaid.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.560
We're going to build our
own machine learning model...

00:04:48.584 --> 00:04:53.584
...using the iris dataset and then we're
also going to do some image detection...

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.930
...where we can feed the machine learning
model an image and it's going to predict...

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.970
...what the image is of.

00:04:59.994 --> 00:05:04.294
And you're actually going to see
how this magic of machine learning...

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.430
...works underneath the hood. As you can
see we have a ton to cover in this course.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.510
And by the end of it all...

00:05:10.534 --> 00:05:14.569
...this is all going to fit in together and
makes sense from the very beginning...

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.300
...of Python basics to the
very end with machine learning.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.229
We're going to take
you from zero to mastery.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.960
But you know what...

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.660
...the best part of this course
is our online community.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.550
We have thousands of developers...

00:05:27.574 --> 00:05:31.274
...chatting, every day, helping each
other out, solving problems together...

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.239
...and just talking about the
latest and greatest in programming.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.760
Now this is an optional
resource for you to use.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.989
So you can have back and forth conversations
with other students and myself.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.860
So you feel like you're part of a classroom
and you're not doing this all alone.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.230
But you know what...

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.160
...enough talk.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.459
I know you're getting excited.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.210
I am too.

00:05:50.211 --> 00:05:52.080
So let's get started.
Let's start learning.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.750
And see why Python has become
the most popular language in the world.
