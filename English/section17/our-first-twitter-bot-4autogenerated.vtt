WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:03.810
So we've created this generous bot that follows back.

00:03.900 --> 00:13.050
But what about a narcissist but maybe a bot that loves your own tweets or loves a tweet based on some

00:13.050 --> 00:14.310
certain words.

00:14.310 --> 00:16.320
How can we built that.

00:16.340 --> 00:25.760
Well let's remove this generous bot for now or at least comment it out and leave it at the bottom.

00:25.760 --> 00:30.920
What do you want to do is let's say we want to search the keywords

00:34.080 --> 00:41.110
for now let's just search through number of tweets and we'll set it at 2.

00:41.250 --> 00:53.120
We'll get to what these mean and a second what we're gonna do here is I'm going to say for tweet in

00:53.840 --> 01:01.250
the tweet B dot cursor again this time around instead of going through followers I want to go through

01:01.250 --> 01:02.300
tweets.

01:02.300 --> 01:06.690
So in here I can do something called API dot search.

01:06.770 --> 01:14.120
If we go to the documentation here and we go to the API reference we see we have API dot search that

01:14.120 --> 01:19.440
returns tweets that match a specified query again.

01:19.450 --> 01:30.090
If I go back I can just say API dot search to search the tweets and we just search based on the term

01:30.330 --> 01:31.610
which is right here.

01:31.650 --> 01:35.030
Search Let's rename this just so we know it's different.

01:35.130 --> 01:39.060
Search string let's make this a little bit smaller.

01:39.390 --> 01:47.870
So this is going to be search string so we're gonna search the tweets with the search string of Python

01:48.110 --> 01:51.860
so we're gonna try and find all the tweets that contain the word python.

01:52.610 --> 01:56.210
And I'm also going to do items in here so we can loop through them.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.560
But within the items I can give it.

01:58.580 --> 02:05.060
How many items that we want to loop through in this case we just want to find the two tweets.

02:05.120 --> 02:15.760
So a number of items it's going to be two and in here we're gonna have another try block and this try

02:15.760 --> 02:25.320
block is just going to say tweet dot favorite to favorite the tweet that includes python and we'll just

02:25.320 --> 02:35.450
print to make sure that it worked I liked that tweet finally here we can also add the limit handler

02:35.600 --> 02:41.090
to this cursor but because we're only going through two items I think we should be fine although it's

02:41.090 --> 02:46.550
always a good idea to wrap the limit handler with a tweet cursor like we did before but I just want

02:46.550 --> 02:54.140
to keep this clean so you can see what's going on now in here we've printed this we'll do an asset block

02:54.140 --> 03:01.700
here that will say 3P dot to weepy here.

03:01.720 --> 03:05.260
So this is if the tweet be errors we'll just say as E.

03:05.560 --> 03:13.120
And in here we'll just print the reason for the error.

03:13.170 --> 03:21.500
And then finally if we get any stop iteration errors in that case we can just break out of the loop

03:22.970 --> 03:25.630
so let's save this and see if this works.

03:26.420 --> 03:35.230
Prone to open up my console and run.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.310
All right we got an error.

03:36.350 --> 03:44.850
We have to be has no attribute to BP error and that's because it should be too deep error again.

03:44.880 --> 03:48.850
Let's run this and oh boy.

03:48.850 --> 03:50.380
We have another error here.

03:51.240 --> 04:01.940
This time around there's no tweet dot favorite but if I go to the API and I do let's say favorite.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.190
I don't get any results.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.240
And this is because I'm Canadian.

04:06.320 --> 04:14.150
And fun fact if you're Canadian This is how you spell favorite but in the States you spell favorite

04:14.360 --> 04:16.500
like this with an Oh.

04:17.060 --> 04:17.700
There you go.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.030
We have a favorite method here

04:22.800 --> 04:32.580
so again fun fact I'm Canadian but also Romanian and that was my spelling error because while TB was

04:32.610 --> 04:36.820
obviously written by person speaking American English.

04:36.830 --> 04:37.070
All right.

04:37.080 --> 04:37.970
So let's give it a go

04:41.020 --> 04:43.030
and it looks like we have twice.

04:43.030 --> 04:44.410
I like that tweet.

04:44.410 --> 04:54.970
Let's go back to check of this work if I go back to let's say profile and look at likes.

04:54.990 --> 04:55.770
Look at that.

04:55.860 --> 05:02.670
I've liked a tweet that happened one hour ago that had the word python and another tweet that I have

05:02.670 --> 05:05.550
no idea what's saying but looks like there's python in here.

05:05.580 --> 05:08.420
Yeah look there's a python right over there.

05:08.460 --> 05:10.690
Hopefully none of these say anything bad.

05:10.890 --> 05:12.470
But look at that.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.000
You can see here that I've liked these tweets.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.660
I'm going to remove that just because I don't know if I should be like these.

05:18.660 --> 05:19.230
There you go.

05:19.230 --> 05:21.060
How cool is that.

05:21.100 --> 05:29.380
So now are narcissistic tweet can potentially just tweet anything that says our own name or like our

05:29.380 --> 05:33.540
own name if there's ever a tweet that has my own name.

05:33.550 --> 05:34.260
Well let's do that.

05:34.270 --> 05:34.920
Let's.

05:35.080 --> 05:42.840
Like the five tweets that have my own name and my narcissistic bought will hopefully work and look at

05:42.840 --> 05:43.590
that.

05:43.650 --> 05:48.960
This is kind of embarrassing but it looks like I've already liked two of those tweets.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.410
You have already favorite ad this status.

05:51.510 --> 05:57.120
But let's go back fi refresh here now.

05:57.130 --> 05:57.900
All right.

05:58.000 --> 05:58.690
Look at that.

05:58.930 --> 06:05.770
I have favorite ad all the tweets that include my names and looks like these ones I've already liked

06:05.860 --> 06:06.640
before.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.710
Very very cool.

06:08.710 --> 06:13.500
There is my narcissistic but and you can do different things here.

06:13.520 --> 06:18.350
For example I can re tweet as well if I wanted to instead of favorite.

06:18.350 --> 06:24.380
So now you know how on Twitter you always have those bots that somehow always read tweet something.

06:24.380 --> 06:25.710
Well this is what they do.

06:25.730 --> 06:33.560
They look for a keyword like Javascript or Python or whatever and they automatically retweeted.

06:33.560 --> 06:41.420
Very very cool as you can see this tweet library is very useful and combined with the Twitter API you

06:41.420 --> 06:43.570
can do some really interesting things.

06:43.610 --> 06:49.670
But again you want to be responsible here because there's a lot of ways that you can abuse and just

06:49.670 --> 06:51.170
spam people with Twitter.

06:51.170 --> 06:53.880
But hopefully now you see some use cases.

06:53.900 --> 06:59.600
For example if you want to follow back all your followers instead of clicking through every single profile

06:59.810 --> 07:04.910
you now have a programmer's way of solving that problem with good ol python.

07:05.690 --> 07:07.450
I'll see in the next one by.
