Welcome back.

00:01.960 --> 00:08.830
It's time for us to do something more useful and what I want to do is actually combine PDX so I have

00:08.830 --> 00:10.120
this dummy.

00:10.330 --> 00:18.130
And then I also have this two page PDA and maybe we have a scenario where we want to combine PD FS to

00:18.130 --> 00:22.430
form just one super PDA how can we do that.

00:22.570 --> 00:25.990
Well let's create a python program.

00:26.110 --> 00:32.560
What I want to do is I want to be able to call Python 3 PD F and then give it some arguments maybe to

00:32.560 --> 00:44.050
be able to say dummy dot PD F and then combining it with two page dot PD f and you know what let's combine

00:44.080 --> 00:50.050
tilt dot PD F as well and we can just keep adding and adding and adding different PD FS and combining

00:50.050 --> 00:50.560
them.

00:50.560 --> 00:51.320
Wouldn't that be cool.

00:51.940 --> 00:54.070
Well let's do that.

00:54.160 --> 01:01.790
The first thing I'm going to do is import the CIS module so that we can get the arguments.

01:01.840 --> 01:10.080
So I'm going to say inputs is going to equal CIS dot arc the and I'm going to do a little trick here.

01:10.170 --> 01:19.080
I'm going to say 1 and then call and remember this is going to grab all the arguments besides the first

01:19.080 --> 01:26.920
one which is our python file but it's going to grab all of these into a list called inputs so we can

01:26.920 --> 01:30.270
include as many PDX as we want from here.

01:30.310 --> 01:38.470
Let's create a function just to have our code be clean so I'm going to remove this and call a function

01:38.660 --> 01:48.040
PD f combining this PD off combined is going to take a PDA off the list which is going to be our inputs.

01:48.490 --> 01:51.030
And what should we do here.

01:51.680 --> 01:54.590
The first thing I want to do is just make sure my code works.

01:54.590 --> 02:06.760
So I'm going to do a for loop and say PD F in PD F list and we're just going to print the PD F so again

02:06.790 --> 02:08.090
just to test our code.

02:08.140 --> 02:09.210
Let's see if this works.

02:09.220 --> 02:16.040
I'm going to run this code well and we have to call our function.

02:16.040 --> 02:23.400
So it's a PDA f combined air and just give it the inputs so I'm going to run this.

02:23.740 --> 02:26.060
And there we go our three PD Fs.

02:26.080 --> 02:26.730
That's great.

02:26.920 --> 02:34.980
But we want to actually combine these so the way to do this is we actually have a merger object with

02:34.980 --> 02:36.610
P Y PD F.

02:36.810 --> 02:51.940
So this merger object we can say P Y PD f dot PD f file merger so that gives us a merger object and

02:51.940 --> 02:55.780
the cool thing is that this is gonna be really simple.

02:55.780 --> 03:03.550
All we have to do here is within our loop say merger dot append

03:06.940 --> 03:12.940
so this just tells us hey merge everything into this merger object the PDL said we're going to loop

03:12.940 --> 03:20.530
through and at the end of the loop this merger is going to have all of these three PBS and all we need

03:20.530 --> 03:36.730
to do is say merger dot right and just write the new PD F as well let's call it Super dot PD F so let's

03:36.730 --> 03:40.930
see if this works I'm going to run.

03:41.070 --> 03:44.830
And did you see that we now have a super PDA.

03:45.540 --> 03:46.560
If I open this

03:51.920 --> 03:57.740
all right we have the dummy PDA F and we see over here we have four pages we have dummy PDA f we have

03:57.860 --> 04:06.340
the simple PDA file that has two pages and we have our rotated dummy PDA file.

04:06.380 --> 04:15.520
How cool is that and notice here that we didn't have to even do the with open as file and then actually

04:15.520 --> 04:22.090
write we can just use the merger data right method to write our file.

04:22.090 --> 04:29.090
So we have a PDA of combining if we're working on a book for example and maybe we have different people

04:29.090 --> 04:34.800
working on different chapters I can just run it through this function now and combine my entire PDA

04:34.800 --> 04:40.120
off into one very very cool or at least I think it's cool.

04:40.130 --> 04:42.810
I hope you find this interesting as well.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.120
But you know what.

04:44.210 --> 04:47.360
Let's go even higher in the next video.

04:47.360 --> 04:51.650
I want to do something that's actually I think quite useful.

04:51.650 --> 04:54.320
So let's take a break and I'll see you in the next one.
