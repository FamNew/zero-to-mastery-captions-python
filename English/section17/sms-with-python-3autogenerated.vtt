00:00.510 --> 00:01.680
Welcome back.

00:01.710 --> 00:07.530
So I've just found exactly the code that I need to send myself a text message.

00:08.430 --> 00:09.510
Let's give that a go.

00:09.510 --> 00:18.220
I'm going to copy and paste into my S M S dot pi file that I just created in my tax me folder and all

00:18.220 --> 00:22.720
right that looks like it's the code that I need.

00:22.720 --> 00:29.560
Now before I do this it looks like this gives me a nice dashboard to test on my code before I actually

00:29.560 --> 00:30.310
run it myself.

00:30.940 --> 00:39.500
So I'm going to here in this to field actually put my phone number down.

00:39.580 --> 00:40.960
Now I'm going to blur this out.

00:41.110 --> 00:45.180
I don't want people text me because I'm already bad at answering text as it is

00:49.300 --> 00:54.970
and the body over here will say hey are you not.

00:54.970 --> 00:56.020
Let's go.

00:56.020 --> 00:57.940
Hello.

00:57.940 --> 00:58.640
There we go.

00:58.660 --> 01:02.120
And we see over here that it actually updates right over here.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.570
So let's make their request and see what happens

01:07.520 --> 01:14.560
so I get a 400 bad request the two number is not a valid phone number.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.740
And that's because I forgot the prefix.

01:16.750 --> 01:22.540
Let's do a make request again.

01:22.610 --> 01:22.990
All right.

01:23.000 --> 01:23.830
And I get an error.

01:23.840 --> 01:30.260
The number is unverified trial accounts cannot send messages to unverified numbers.

01:30.440 --> 01:34.760
So I have to verify my number that they gave me.

01:34.790 --> 01:39.840
That's kind of annoying but Maria let's let's do that all right.

01:39.840 --> 01:47.130
So after a bit of searching I saw over here that we can go to phone numbers and in the verified caller

01:47.130 --> 01:49.750
I.D. I have to verify my number.

01:49.740 --> 01:54.440
So I actually have to enter my real phone number so that they can verify it.

01:54.450 --> 02:01.190
I guess this is so that people can just spam random phone numbers which makes sense.

02:01.230 --> 02:03.360
So let's see where is Canada here.

02:03.570 --> 02:05.400
And I'm going to hide my number again

02:08.120 --> 02:13.390
and I guess or we can I don't want you to call me so let's do text instead.

02:13.510 --> 02:17.970
Oh I have to enter it again.

02:18.010 --> 02:18.190
All right.

02:18.190 --> 02:22.990
Text me Yep I got a verification code.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.050
Submit.

02:24.150 --> 02:26.730
That's kind of cool I got a text on my phone.

02:26.730 --> 02:26.970
All right.

02:26.970 --> 02:28.470
So I have my verified number.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.500
Let's go back to where were we.

02:31.500 --> 02:43.460
We were doing our project get started all right and we have to do hello and we'll use python again

02:47.030 --> 02:47.570
okay.

02:47.690 --> 02:49.980
Let's make their request and see what happens.

02:52.230 --> 02:52.810
Hey.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.370
Two hundred and one created.

02:54.460 --> 02:55.960
Their request was successful

02:58.480 --> 03:00.000
and holy moly.

03:00.010 --> 03:08.170
I'm I'm going to post this on the screen but I just got a text from William says hello.

03:08.170 --> 03:09.070
Not mind you.

03:09.070 --> 03:12.010
It says that a sent from a 12 year old trial account.

03:12.010 --> 03:18.910
So obviously when I have a fully paid non trial account it wouldn't say this but this is awesome.

03:18.910 --> 03:21.380
I just received a text.

03:21.420 --> 03:21.660
All right.

03:21.670 --> 03:24.580
So I didn't even have to open anything really.

03:24.580 --> 03:27.790
I can just copy and paste this into

03:30.510 --> 03:31.820
my project file.

03:32.730 --> 03:38.490
I just need to copy the author token which in here they automatically include by I am assume that I

03:38.490 --> 03:41.550
can get the author tokens somehow from here.

03:41.550 --> 03:46.610
Let's see how we can grab it the two settings.

03:49.750 --> 03:58.610
I'll search off token leads to authorized apps there should no not there.

03:58.620 --> 03:59.600
Where could it be.

03:59.610 --> 04:04.270
Must go to user settings.

04:04.280 --> 04:09.380
No that's not it.

04:09.780 --> 04:10.290
That's silly.

04:10.290 --> 04:12.390
Look at that in the dashboard auth token.

04:12.390 --> 04:17.040
I can just click view definitely going to hide that.

04:17.060 --> 04:17.780
After this

04:21.850 --> 04:29.590
so now ortho can I can just paste it in here and I can change the body to whatever I want so I'll say

04:30.220 --> 04:36.540
I can't believe this works.

04:36.620 --> 04:47.300
Now the other thing is is we have to download the Twilio library so let's just say Pip 3 install Twilio

04:52.340 --> 04:52.710
all right.

04:52.710 --> 04:56.380
And this is now installed and let's run this file.

04:56.400 --> 05:01.140
I'm going to say Python 3 s m s dot pi

05:05.430 --> 05:05.970
all right.

05:07.110 --> 05:08.290
Looks like it may have worked.

05:08.290 --> 05:10.710
Let's see oh boy.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.490
I am taking a screenshot of this.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.640
That definitely worked.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.600
I just received a text message.

05:15.620 --> 05:16.810
How cool is that.

05:17.180 --> 05:26.590
Now the reason I showed you this text tutorial is not because you really learn anything from it.

05:26.630 --> 05:31.730
I just wanted to show you my thought process when I work through things that maybe I haven't encountered

05:31.760 --> 05:32.660
before.

05:32.780 --> 05:34.320
It's a lot of trial and error.

05:34.430 --> 05:35.600
Knowing where to look.

05:35.600 --> 05:42.170
For example I knew that Twilio was a popular tool for text messaging but even googling you're most likely

05:42.170 --> 05:47.840
going to come across Twilio and then it's all about reading about their API and what you can do and

05:47.840 --> 05:52.910
most of them like 20 years if they're big enough have really good documentation where you basically

05:52.910 --> 05:55.230
don't even have to code.

05:55.330 --> 06:01.510
Now the beauty here is that in a couple of minutes I was able to send myself a text message and now

06:01.510 --> 06:04.590
there's so many use cases that you can think of.

06:04.660 --> 06:11.170
Again we want to start thinking like programmers how can we use this maybe when we receive an email

06:11.170 --> 06:13.240
from an important person.

06:13.360 --> 06:20.590
Maybe when we get a specific tweet that we're interested in maybe we can receive a text using the Twilio

06:20.590 --> 06:21.940
API.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.830
Maybe you have a portfolio Web site and you want to get a text.

06:26.830 --> 06:33.220
Anytime somebody completes your contact form or maybe orders your product from your startup landing

06:33.220 --> 06:34.210
page.

06:34.210 --> 06:40.690
The possibilities are endless but with that you've just learned how to send yourself a text message.

06:40.690 --> 06:43.320
That was a lot of fun but I think we deserve a break now.

06:43.420 --> 06:44.930
So I'll see you in the next video.
