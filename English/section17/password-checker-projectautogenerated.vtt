Hello I'm super super excited because this is my favorite project of the entire course.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.730
As a matter of fact I wish I could just do this over and over.

00:11.800 --> 00:16.920
I'm telling you this project is going to wow you now.

00:17.020 --> 00:24.850
It's one of these projects that initially it doesn't sound that exciting but I included it in our course

00:25.150 --> 00:31.360
because I guarantee you you talk about this project to an employer and they're going to be impressed

00:31.630 --> 00:33.020
with your knowledge.

00:33.100 --> 00:40.840
It's an actual tool that I use day to day for security reasons and I'm really excited for us to build

00:40.840 --> 00:42.480
this together by the end of it.

00:42.520 --> 00:46.690
I promise you you're gonna be extremely happy with it.

00:47.050 --> 00:53.260
OK maybe I'm a little bit overly excited about this kind of stuff but hey who knows maybe you will to

00:54.440 --> 01:02.060
what we're going to build is a password checker but not just any silly dumb password checker.

01:02.090 --> 01:09.230
This is legitimately going to be the most secure way for you to check if your password has ever been

01:09.230 --> 01:10.190
hacked.

01:10.190 --> 01:10.610
That's right.

01:11.270 --> 01:21.990
So what's going to happen is we're gonna be able to type in our terminal Python 3 and then we'll have

01:21.990 --> 01:30.630
a check my pass got pi file that we're going to write from scratch in here when we run this program

01:30.990 --> 01:40.340
we're gonna be able to input any password that we have and check if it's ever been hacked.

01:40.450 --> 01:46.150
Now we'll get into how this works and how we know a password has been hacked in the next video but just

01:46.150 --> 01:47.740
to show you how this works.

01:47.830 --> 01:58.640
If I say let's say hello as a password let's say if Hello has ever been hacked maybe passwords 1 2 3

01:58.850 --> 02:02.270
and then a super tough password like this.

02:02.270 --> 02:05.780
So it's going to be able to check as many passwords as we list here.

02:05.900 --> 02:12.980
And if I hit enter it's actually going to check these passwords and we can see that.

02:12.980 --> 02:15.740
Hello was actually found.

02:15.740 --> 02:16.310
What is this.

02:16.310 --> 02:23.090
Two hundred and fifty three thousand five hundred and eighty one times so it's been hacked that many

02:23.090 --> 02:26.650
times so you definitely shouldn't use this password password.

02:26.650 --> 02:28.340
One two three as we can guess.

02:28.370 --> 02:30.830
Yeah you shouldn't use that password.

02:30.830 --> 02:33.350
What about this one this gibberish password.

02:33.530 --> 02:36.560
This password has actually never been found.

02:36.560 --> 02:42.020
So you should carry on and use this password over the next couple of videos.

02:42.020 --> 02:47.780
We're going to build this tool a tool that you can actually use in real life to check if your password

02:47.840 --> 02:49.340
is secure.

02:49.340 --> 02:51.910
Now how does this work.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.600
Let's explore that in the next video.
