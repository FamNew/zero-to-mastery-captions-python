00:00.360 --> 00:03.810
So again I haven't really done this much before.

00:03.810 --> 00:07.230
But let's see if I can send myself a text message.

00:07.230 --> 00:11.980
I'm going to say get started with programmable Azzam S. All right.

00:11.990 --> 00:13.820
And I'm building my application.

00:13.840 --> 00:17.260
Looks like it can just click on just exploring.

00:17.260 --> 00:21.480
Let's see how I can do this really really fast.

00:21.480 --> 00:29.070
First I have to get a Tulio phone number so in order to send a message I need a phone number and this

00:29.070 --> 00:31.140
is my Twilio phone number.

00:32.200 --> 00:32.460
Right.

00:32.480 --> 00:33.890
So we'll choose this number.

00:33.890 --> 00:37.270
That's great.

00:37.300 --> 00:37.500
All right.

00:37.510 --> 00:39.730
I'm gonna copy this number in case I need it.

00:39.730 --> 00:40.980
Let's click done.

00:41.260 --> 00:48.040
And by the way a job of a programmer is to well most of the time read documentation Google around and

00:48.040 --> 00:50.680
just figure out how things work in general.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.620
You're just a problem solver right.

00:53.620 --> 00:58.150
So we have send a message here.

00:58.230 --> 01:01.660
We have my phone number that I just received.

01:02.100 --> 01:05.630
And let's see over here in the right to request it looks like.

01:05.660 --> 01:05.940
Oh yeah.

01:05.940 --> 01:06.480
Look at that.

01:06.480 --> 01:10.760
I can click on Python and it shows me exactly how cool is this.

01:10.800 --> 01:11.550
Exactly.

01:11.550 --> 01:15.450
What code I need to send my message all right.

01:15.450 --> 01:21.590
And it gives me even the auth token and the s I.D. and looks like the ortho can.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.780
I'll have to grab.

01:23.020 --> 01:28.420
All right in the next video we're going to copy this code and tried to sent myself a text message.

01:28.470 --> 01:29.250
Let's see if it works.
