Let's talk about image processing.

00:02.850 --> 00:11.200
If this is something that happens a lot and a lot of companies process images or videos what do I mean.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.920
Well Instagram here for example you may have used this service.

00:14.920 --> 00:20.450
What you do is you upload your pictures and Instagram displays it to all your friends.

00:20.560 --> 00:27.310
But if I click on one of these pictures here this image is an actually the image that I uploaded to

00:27.310 --> 00:32.240
Instagram because the image that I uploaded to Instagram was very large.

00:32.290 --> 00:35.290
It was probably around five megabytes.

00:35.290 --> 00:39.490
What Instagram does is it processes this image.

00:39.490 --> 00:46.600
Maybe it adds some cool filters for me to make it look nice but it also crops this image and makes it

00:46.600 --> 00:47.080
small.

00:47.110 --> 00:49.900
So it's only a couple of hundred of kilobytes.

00:50.110 --> 00:52.060
Now why would they do this.

00:52.210 --> 00:59.680
They do this because A they make pictures look nicer but also to save themselves a bit of money if they

00:59.740 --> 01:04.730
uploaded all the pictures that they have from all their users.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.000
And each picture was a couple of megabytes.

01:08.110 --> 01:15.400
That's a lot of store space for them to have to hold on to these pictures because each of these pictures

01:15.460 --> 01:21.340
are on their servers so they save a lot of money by compressing these images.

01:21.550 --> 01:24.440
The same thing happens on udemy as well.

01:24.620 --> 01:29.680
You may have watched a course on something like you Demi and thought men these videos are a little bit

01:29.680 --> 01:30.130
blurry.

01:30.130 --> 01:32.350
I wish there were a little clearer.

01:32.350 --> 01:34.660
Well you Demi does the same thing.

01:34.690 --> 01:41.950
They host all of these videos and if they hosted the original version of the videos such as the ones

01:41.950 --> 01:48.100
that I record in the full format well that's going to cost them a lot of money.

01:48.220 --> 01:56.470
So they're able to save money by compressing these videos so that they're smaller versions but also

01:56.470 --> 02:02.290
help out other students that maybe my watch these videos then don't have a good internet connection

02:02.290 --> 02:07.270
to watch them in HD so this is a very common problem.

02:07.290 --> 02:10.570
So we're going to learn all about that now.

02:10.640 --> 02:12.410
What are we going to use.

02:12.500 --> 02:17.440
The key thing is that internet is your friend as a python developer.

02:17.480 --> 02:24.020
You should be able to find these libraries by just doing a simple google search such as image processing

02:24.050 --> 02:24.440
python.

02:24.930 --> 02:32.650
And we see over here a bunch of resources like 10 Python image manipulation tools or things like open

02:32.650 --> 02:38.770
CV which we'll talk about but I'll save you the hassle and tell you what we're going to use we're going

02:38.770 --> 02:45.440
to use something called pillow which is a pretty standard library to use with Python when manipulating

02:45.740 --> 02:46.900
images.

02:47.030 --> 02:51.710
What we're going to do is actually install this pillar library and there's a couple of warnings here

02:51.710 --> 02:59.340
that we're going to get to in the next video but ideally all you're going to do is while you can just

02:59.470 --> 03:01.040
pip install pillow.

03:01.230 --> 03:03.160
So let's do that.

03:03.210 --> 03:10.000
I have a folder here and a project that we're gonna be working on so ignore the right side here.

03:10.200 --> 03:15.490
But in here all I'm going to do is a Pip and I want to make sure I'm using paper 3.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.160
Again this is something we've talked about.

03:17.160 --> 03:17.870
It's up to you.

03:17.880 --> 03:28.130
Make sure that we're using the latest version of Pip and then say install below and in my case it's

03:28.130 --> 03:29.510
already installed for you.

03:29.510 --> 03:35.430
It may take a little bit longer to install this package now in the next video.

03:35.490 --> 03:41.470
I'm going to talk a little bit about this warning which actually leads us to a key developer fundamental.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.630
So I'll see you now on.
