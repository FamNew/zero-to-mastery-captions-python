00:01.070 --> 00:01.610
All right.

00:01.640 --> 00:03.020
How was that.

00:03.020 --> 00:05.450
Hopefully you were able to figure it out.

00:05.510 --> 00:06.770
If not don't worry.

00:06.770 --> 00:18.370
Here's the solution what I'm going to do here is just keep the P Y PD f import and start from scratch.

00:18.570 --> 00:25.560
The first thing I want to do is I want to grab this super dope EDF that we're going to process.

00:26.010 --> 00:35.460
So again I'll just call it the template and this template will be the P Y PD f we'll use the PD f file

00:35.610 --> 00:42.280
reader object and I'll actually show you a little shortcut instead of just opening it the way we have

00:42.280 --> 00:52.590
been before we can just inside of here say open and then say super dot PD F which is why we're going

00:52.590 --> 01:02.630
to open and then open it with the second parameter being read binary just like this.

01:02.760 --> 01:05.580
We're going to create a file reader.

01:05.610 --> 01:08.250
Now you can do it this way or the way that I've shown you before.

01:08.280 --> 01:13.680
This is just a cleaner syntax that I like using next.

01:13.680 --> 01:22.030
I also want to open up the watermark PDA so I'm going to call it watermark and again we're going to

01:22.300 --> 01:23.250
use the same thing.

01:23.260 --> 01:34.150
So I'm going to say file reader and instead of opening the super PDA F I'll open the watermark PDA and

01:34.150 --> 01:39.470
then finally I want to be able to write my output and combine these two.

01:39.520 --> 01:53.560
So I'm going to say output equals and we'll say pi PD f dot PD f file writer to create our write object

01:53.620 --> 01:56.910
in memory now from here.

01:56.910 --> 01:58.440
This is the tricky part.

01:58.470 --> 02:06.680
Ideally we loop through the pages here of the template and add the watermark to it.

02:06.730 --> 02:11.130
Now we are not going to know how many pages supercop EDF has.

02:11.170 --> 02:17.800
I mean we might want to change this program so that we use the command line here to give it a file but

02:17.800 --> 02:24.700
ideally we want to make a program that is flexible and no matter how many pages the given PDL has we

02:24.700 --> 02:26.580
can process it.

02:26.580 --> 02:34.770
So what I'm going to do is use a for loop here and we can also create a function if we want but for

02:34.770 --> 02:40.480
now because this is going to be just one block of code we can just keep it without a function.

02:40.770 --> 02:50.450
And I'm going to say for I in range because we don't know how big this file is going to be and what

02:50.450 --> 03:01.780
I'm going to say is template dot get num pages get nom pages is going to tell me how many pages the

03:01.780 --> 03:03.810
template has.

03:03.850 --> 03:11.310
Remember we've also seen the way of saying num pages in a previous lesson but we can just use get num

03:11.310 --> 03:13.870
pages just to show you something different.

03:13.890 --> 03:19.020
So now it's going to get the number of pages it's going to create a range objects out of it.

03:19.170 --> 03:20.620
And we're going to loop through it.

03:20.670 --> 03:28.740
So if we have five pages it's going to loop five times now in here what we can do is have a page object.

03:28.760 --> 03:34.220
So we're going to say template get page of the index that we're at.

03:34.220 --> 03:38.210
So this is going to go through each time and it's going gonna get the first page the first time around

03:38.300 --> 03:43.550
the second page the third page the fourth page so that we go through everything and that's gonna be

03:43.550 --> 03:44.160
our page.

03:44.240 --> 03:57.220
Object next where we're going to do is say page dot merge page and this merge page is simply going to

03:57.220 --> 04:09.550
get the watermark dot get page at index of 0 because the watermark PD f only has that one page that

04:09.550 --> 04:19.090
has the watermark so I'm going to merge onto that page the watermark now.

04:19.100 --> 04:27.630
Notice here that I didn't use the PDA f file merger and also you y merch page works the way it does

04:28.380 --> 04:33.460
when we finished a project but you can use either one.

04:33.570 --> 04:40.920
The key here with merch page is that I like the PDA file merger which combines the files one after another

04:41.240 --> 04:46.860
merge page actually well merge as the page like we want with the watermark.

04:46.860 --> 04:52.800
Now this is something that you would have had to read through the documentation if you tried the exercise

04:52.830 --> 04:53.820
on your own.

04:53.820 --> 04:59.390
Again one of those things that you just have to practice that muscle finally.

04:59.410 --> 05:09.390
Now that we have the page we can say output which is the PDA rider that we're gonna have our output

05:10.170 --> 05:20.500
will be the ad page and we're going to add this page that we've merged and now finally what we can do

05:20.500 --> 05:35.470
in here is say with open and we'll call this new PD f let's call it watermarked output dot PD f we're

05:35.470 --> 05:39.920
going to say right binary and we're gonna call it as

05:43.200 --> 05:43.520
so then.

05:43.520 --> 05:51.690
Now if we do output dot right and right this file let's see what happens.

05:51.750 --> 05:56.590
I'm going to run my program and then go nowhere.

05:56.640 --> 05:57.470
Let's see if it worked.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.380
We see that we have a watermarked output now.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.960
Again this is gibberish but if we open this

06:06.020 --> 06:10.440
check that out we have our dummy PDA file.

06:10.690 --> 06:13.140
We have the draft over here on the second page.

06:13.270 --> 06:18.910
Third page and even the fourth page with the rotation.

06:18.910 --> 06:20.840
How cool is that.

06:20.860 --> 06:28.430
We just created a PDA off watermark or that was quite simple right again.

06:28.510 --> 06:34.030
If this is confusing and you're saying Hey Andre I didn't get this am I a bad programmer.

06:34.150 --> 06:34.900
No you're not.

06:34.900 --> 06:38.690
This is very library specific right.

06:38.830 --> 06:42.620
You're never gonna get asked this exact syntax in an interview.

06:42.640 --> 06:46.790
Instead you read the documentation you want to merge pages.

06:46.810 --> 06:54.880
So you Google something like merge page on the official documentation of a library and you figure out

06:55.840 --> 06:58.720
hey merge pages right here.

06:58.840 --> 07:01.220
I can read one merge page does that is we see.

07:01.240 --> 07:04.660
Oh yeah merges the content streams of two pages into one.

07:04.660 --> 07:04.980
All right.

07:05.020 --> 07:05.980
That's what we need.

07:05.980 --> 07:06.900
So that's what we use.

07:06.910 --> 07:12.190
And you experiment go back and forth until you have a working project.

07:12.280 --> 07:13.200
There you have it.

07:13.270 --> 07:15.640
You can now work in Hollywood.

07:15.640 --> 07:16.770
Congratulations.

07:16.780 --> 07:18.750
I'll see you in the next video.

07:18.780 --> 07:19.030
Bye bye.
