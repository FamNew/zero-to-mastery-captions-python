00:00.690 --> 00:01.760
All right enough talk.

00:01.780 --> 00:07.570
Let's process some images and use our Python knowledge.

00:07.750 --> 00:14.140
Now you might be thinking that image processing is something that you can do on your machine using something

00:14.140 --> 00:17.920
like Photoshop even using a simple editing software.

00:17.920 --> 00:24.360
But where this tool really shines is when we have to process hundreds thousands of images.

00:24.400 --> 00:29.990
You can do things really really fast with Python so let's get started with this.

00:30.070 --> 00:38.200
I've actually attached to this lesson a poke index for you and this poke index has all these cute little

00:38.520 --> 00:39.170
pockmarks.

00:39.220 --> 00:44.590
We have bubbles are we have Charmander we have Pikachu we have Squirtle it's great.

00:44.590 --> 00:46.180
They're all extremely cute.

00:46.180 --> 00:51.280
And by the way a little bonus just for taking this course no other course is going to teach you this.

00:51.280 --> 00:51.970
Get ready for it.

00:52.030 --> 01:02.230
You ready was our original name in Japanese is for shaggy done it Charmander ball Charmander is he took

01:02.330 --> 01:09.630
it and then pick it you while he could choose just peek at you and then Squirtle is then you got it.

01:09.790 --> 01:10.370
There you go.

01:10.390 --> 01:11.740
Free Japanese lesson.

01:11.740 --> 01:13.960
Bonus for this Python course.

01:14.050 --> 01:17.420
Yes this is that good of a course.

01:17.440 --> 01:17.880
All right.

01:17.920 --> 01:21.490
Let's get back to some serious stuff we have these images.

01:21.490 --> 01:23.900
Let's see what we can do with them.

01:23.920 --> 01:30.310
I'm going to have an image dog pie file so you can just create this on your own and I'm using sublime

01:30.310 --> 01:31.720
text here and my command prompt.

01:31.750 --> 01:38.850
But you can use whatever you want and what I'm about to show you is something that remember you can

01:38.940 --> 01:43.190
always reference in the official documentation when learning a library.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.990
There's nothing better than the official documentation.

01:46.020 --> 01:46.770
Right.

01:46.800 --> 01:52.290
And we see over here that the first thing we need to do is to actually import the module just like this

01:53.930 --> 02:01.610
so let's go back here and say from pill import Image.

02:01.610 --> 02:04.030
So now we can do something pretty exciting.

02:04.190 --> 02:15.680
The first thing we can do is say image equals image that we've imported and just simply say open now

02:15.770 --> 02:19.910
in here we just give it a file path that we want to open in our case.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.110
Let's open up Peek At You dot JPEG.

02:22.160 --> 02:27.850
So I'm going to say dot slash which means current directory.

02:28.050 --> 02:31.610
And remember we're in the image playground directory.

02:31.710 --> 02:41.330
And I want to go inside of the poke index folder so I'm going to say Poke index and say slash Peek At

02:41.330 --> 02:41.890
You.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.460
Make sure I spell peek at you right here

02:46.470 --> 02:55.470
dot JPEG and let's just print the image here to see what we get going to save and run this file.

02:55.490 --> 03:04.300
So I'm going to say Python 3 and run the image dot pi file

03:07.100 --> 03:14.110
images dot pi file because that's the name.

03:14.150 --> 03:15.030
There you go.

03:15.050 --> 03:17.180
We get an object here.

03:17.180 --> 03:18.980
You see it's a pill object.

03:18.980 --> 03:24.500
It's a JPEG image plugin JPEG image file and it tells me exactly what it is.

03:24.500 --> 03:32.660
So we've converted or opened up this JPEG into an image object that pillow gives us that we can now

03:32.720 --> 03:33.440
manipulate.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.580
So what can we do here.

03:37.280 --> 03:42.360
Well first let's just see the image dot format.

03:43.010 --> 03:48.800
And this property is going to say hey what is image format image format.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.690
It's a JPEG because well it's a JPEG.

03:51.770 --> 03:52.310
That's awesome.

03:52.310 --> 03:56.560
So we get different properties here but what about size.

03:56.580 --> 03:58.100
Can you tell us about the size.

03:58.300 --> 04:02.610
Well yeah the size of the image is 640 by 640.

04:02.730 --> 04:03.410
Awesome.

04:03.420 --> 04:03.900
That's good.

04:03.900 --> 04:09.540
We get some information what if we do mode here what does mode do.

04:09.540 --> 04:16.940
Let's see now we see that the coloring is in our G.B. so that's red green blue.

04:17.090 --> 04:17.610
All right.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.780
Awesome let's clear the console here.

04:20.780 --> 04:22.160
There you go.

04:22.160 --> 04:30.140
Now remember we're able to figure out what kind of functions methods properties and attributes this

04:30.200 --> 04:32.560
image has by doing the Jerk command.

04:32.570 --> 04:32.870
Right.

04:32.990 --> 04:40.280
So if I just remove this and do her over the image we get.

04:40.300 --> 04:44.490
While all the things that this image has given to us.

04:44.590 --> 04:48.700
And again this is something that we can check on the documentation Web sites as well.

04:49.240 --> 04:49.430
OK.

04:49.450 --> 04:51.830
But let's do something even more exciting.

04:51.850 --> 04:59.090
You know what I want to do I want to be able to maybe add some filters maybe blur things in here.

04:59.110 --> 05:08.760
Well pillow gives us this image filter that we can now filter the image with.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.640
So how can we use it.

05:11.790 --> 05:19.460
Well we can now have a filtered image and this filter image is going to equal the image that we've grabbed

05:19.880 --> 05:22.440
and we're going to say dot filter.

05:22.820 --> 05:28.070
And in here give it the image filter with some options.

05:28.070 --> 05:30.680
So here we can do different things.

05:30.740 --> 05:32.960
Let's do blur here.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.440
So capital blur.

05:34.520 --> 05:38.480
So now it's going to apply a filter of blurring.

05:38.480 --> 05:44.510
So let's see what happens if I do this I'm going to instead of printing I'm actually going to say image

05:45.930 --> 05:48.630
dot save.

05:48.630 --> 05:51.720
And this is going to save the filtered image.

05:51.810 --> 06:01.950
So let's do filtered image dot save and give it let's call it blur comma and then the extension that

06:01.950 --> 06:05.080
we want to say that it lets us do PMG here.

06:05.390 --> 06:08.800
We'll change it to a PMG file like this.

06:08.820 --> 06:16.540
And if I run this look at that we have a new file blurred dot PMG here.

06:16.540 --> 06:20.290
If I click on it pick it you is all blurred up.

06:20.350 --> 06:24.800
You can see the original image right here and the blurred image.

06:24.970 --> 06:28.080
How cool is that so let's do that again.

06:28.080 --> 06:32.610
Let's do something else let's do maybe smooth.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.750
Which is another filter that we can do.

06:34.830 --> 06:35.910
If I run this again

06:40.840 --> 06:41.050
all right.

06:41.050 --> 06:42.980
We see that the image is now.

06:42.980 --> 06:46.680
Well we can't really tell but it's smoother.

06:46.820 --> 06:50.630
That's a filter that usually works better with landscape images.

06:50.630 --> 06:52.810
We can also do something like sharpen.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.870
And again you can read the documentation to see different filtering so that we can do.

06:56.870 --> 06:58.400
But let's check this one out as well.

06:59.660 --> 07:03.690
We've got the original and then the sharpened one here.

07:03.690 --> 07:09.880
You know there's a bit of a notice Pikachu is looking very very sharp.

07:09.980 --> 07:17.210
Now the reason that I've converted this into a G is because PMG supports these image filters so you

07:17.210 --> 07:22.220
might get an error if you actually keep it as a jpeg you know what.

07:22.310 --> 07:25.060
While we're at it let me show you another thing that we can do.

07:25.100 --> 07:33.170
So instead of this filter image we can actually do something called convert and this converts the image

07:33.200 --> 07:35.760
to different formats.

07:35.810 --> 07:42.020
So one of the formats that we can actually do is something called grayscale which is with a capital

07:42.050 --> 07:42.780
L..

07:42.800 --> 07:55.470
So when I do convert like this this image and let's rename it to gray dot PMG if I run this my grade

07:55.470 --> 08:03.690
up to Pikachu is in black and white so you can also convert images to different formats.

08:03.710 --> 08:08.570
So remember we had the RG be red green blue format.

08:08.570 --> 08:11.260
There's different formats that you can convert images to.

08:11.270 --> 08:12.930
But this one looks pretty cool.

08:12.950 --> 08:16.170
We've just great out pikachu.

08:16.270 --> 08:22.060
Now this is just one picture that we've worked with but the power and what I'm going to show you in

08:22.060 --> 08:30.760
the upcoming videos is how we can apply let's say a function like this to hundreds and thousands and

08:30.760 --> 08:34.040
millions of images if we want and process them really fast.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.730
But for now I think this is enough.

08:36.730 --> 08:42.000
You can experiment and try different converts and try a different image filters on your own.

08:42.070 --> 08:45.020
And we're going to learn some more in the next video by.
