00:00.630 --> 00:01.310
Hey hey.

00:01.410 --> 00:05.310
We have another project that we need to work on now.

00:05.310 --> 00:11.340
This project is a little unique because it's well it's gonna be a simple project but I'm going to attempt

00:11.340 --> 00:14.910
to do this with no rehearsal.

00:14.940 --> 00:16.640
I haven't really tried this before.

00:16.650 --> 00:25.740
I want to show you exactly what my process is when I'm exploring an idea let's say I want to send myself

00:25.830 --> 00:27.320
a text message.

00:27.390 --> 00:27.990
That's right.

00:28.080 --> 00:31.440
Using python I want to receive a text message on my phone.

00:31.980 --> 00:34.620
And there's some interesting use cases right.

00:34.650 --> 00:43.440
You can perhaps create a python script that checks the stock price of let's say Apple and maybe sends

00:43.440 --> 00:46.860
you a text that this is now a good time to buy Apple.

00:46.860 --> 00:56.660
When the ticker symbol gets to a certain price or maybe when we create our portfolio in the web development

00:56.660 --> 01:03.770
section of this course and we'll have a contact form for our clients to contact us maybe when that happens

01:03.770 --> 01:07.370
or we want to send ourselves a text message as well.

01:07.370 --> 01:10.490
So this is a very very useful thing to know.

01:10.610 --> 01:12.590
But how can we do that.

01:12.590 --> 01:22.160
Well luckily it's all about APIs and Tulio is the go to when it comes to anything related to communications

01:22.220 --> 01:27.530
whether it's tax the voice or audio Twilio is a great API for you to use.

01:27.560 --> 01:36.410
Now if I click on Twilio here again we see that some big companies are using it but we're also going

01:36.410 --> 01:39.770
to have to sign up to the service.

01:39.900 --> 01:44.100
Now I'm going to save you the trouble of me going through the sign up process.

01:44.100 --> 01:49.540
Instead I'm going to fast forward and I'll show you once I'm logged in.

01:49.570 --> 01:50.340
All right.

01:50.350 --> 01:55.630
Once you're logged in you're gonna get to the dashboard over here and you're going to want to create

01:55.780 --> 01:57.250
a project.

01:57.340 --> 02:03.290
So you see over here that there's a couple of templates they can actually just create for yourself.

02:03.310 --> 02:07.950
You can do phone verification S M S chat bots two factor authentication.

02:08.080 --> 02:12.250
There's even a game learn and explore which allows you to explore the API

02:15.310 --> 02:16.630
in my case.

02:16.630 --> 02:17.820
I don't want to use a template.

02:17.820 --> 02:22.520
I want to just create a product and I want to do a programmable estimates.

02:22.540 --> 02:23.560
That is texting.

02:23.920 --> 02:26.170
So let's continue.

02:26.170 --> 02:32.230
And by the way Web sites like these always change their UI and the visual.

02:32.230 --> 02:37.060
So it might look different for you depending on when you watch the video but all the functionality should

02:37.060 --> 02:38.260
be the same.

02:38.270 --> 02:46.760
I'm going to give my project the name 0 2 mastery texture and let's click Continue.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.290
No I don't have any friends.

02:48.290 --> 02:49.250
This is just me.

02:49.340 --> 02:54.130
So I want an invite to teammate and there we go.

02:54.160 --> 02:57.820
We have our dashboard in the next video.

02:57.820 --> 03:01.000
I'm going to try and attempt to send myself a text message.

03:01.030 --> 03:02.680
Now I haven't really practiced this.

03:02.710 --> 03:03.940
So we'll see how it goes.

03:04.060 --> 03:06.170
We'll do a bit of trial and error.

03:06.220 --> 03:06.940
I'll see in the next one.

03:07.360 --> 03:07.990
Bye bye.
