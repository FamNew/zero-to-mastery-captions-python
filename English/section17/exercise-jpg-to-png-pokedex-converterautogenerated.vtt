00:00.300 --> 00:01.210
Welcome back.

00:01.230 --> 00:06.910
It's time to apply what we just learned and do an exercise and build our own project.

00:07.080 --> 00:08.880
Now what is this project.

00:08.880 --> 00:15.350
This project is going to be a JPEG to PSG converter.

00:15.370 --> 00:17.420
You remember our pocket X right.

00:17.500 --> 00:25.870
Our pocket X are all these cute little pokey months but they're all in j peg format now JPEG image file

00:25.870 --> 00:26.370
format.

00:26.380 --> 00:29.460
You can read up on it but I prefer PMG.

00:29.460 --> 00:34.000
There are some benefits that PMG files have especially for these type of images.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.690
So for example if you're a web developer these types of images with not a lot of color or just a few

00:40.840 --> 00:44.690
colors you can see over here blue brown white.

00:45.040 --> 00:51.240
They're actually better when you develop Web sites to use PMG.

00:51.400 --> 00:54.750
Again that's beyond the scope of the course you can read up on this on your own.

00:54.790 --> 01:00.640
But a J pack too P G converter is really really useful.

01:00.680 --> 01:04.630
So how can we build it based on what we've learned.

01:04.640 --> 01:09.110
I'm going to get you started and the rest I'm going to try and see if we can figure out on your own.

01:09.800 --> 01:18.300
So what I'm going to do first is create a new file in here and I'm going to use the command line.

01:18.300 --> 01:22.720
I can use touch here because I'm using a Mac if you're using Windows.

01:22.720 --> 01:26.770
This command is different and that's something that we've already talked about before.

01:26.950 --> 01:32.370
You can also just manually on your computer just say new file so you can just right click and say a

01:32.370 --> 01:34.750
new file whatever you want.

01:34.750 --> 01:39.550
Well I already did this so instead of doing touch I'll just create a new file and what we'll call it

01:39.760 --> 01:49.950
is I'm going to call it j peg to PMG converter.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.160
There we go.

01:51.160 --> 01:53.640
Now what do we want this to do.

01:53.650 --> 01:59.550
Well we want a python script that I can run that works like this.

01:59.650 --> 02:08.890
I want to be able to say Python 3 and then say JPEG to PMG converted it up by and then give it to arguments.

02:09.040 --> 02:17.490
The first argument is I wanted to give the folder name so I'm going to say Poke it X and we're going

02:17.490 --> 02:20.340
to add a slash here to show that this is a folder.

02:20.350 --> 02:27.520
So I want you to open the pocket X folder and then the second parameter is the new folder that I want

02:27.520 --> 02:28.290
to create.

02:28.300 --> 02:30.760
So let's just call it new.

02:30.790 --> 02:40.280
So this new folder doesn't exist but I want to be able to create it and by the way if you're on a Windows

02:40.370 --> 02:48.760
this slash will be the other one it'll be the backslash like this but essentially what I want to do

02:48.760 --> 02:50.290
is run this command.

02:50.500 --> 02:57.040
It's going to look through all the images here and convert them into a JPEG and put them in a new folder

02:57.370 --> 03:06.600
called New so let's build that script and I'm going to get you started with a little hint.

03:06.600 --> 03:15.980
What we need to do is we need to be able to grab these arguments and also grab all these files and from

03:15.980 --> 03:18.650
the previous sections we should know how to do that.

03:18.680 --> 03:27.860
What I'm going to do is import the CIS module and import the OS module and of course from the pillow

03:27.950 --> 03:34.670
library I'm going to import pill from image it's import here.

03:34.670 --> 03:35.190
There you go.

03:36.600 --> 03:47.890
Now the first step is to actually using the CIS module grab the first and second argument.

03:48.150 --> 03:51.720
So remember that's the pocket X and the new folder.

03:52.260 --> 03:54.410
So that's the first thing we want to do.

03:54.420 --> 04:08.810
The second thing is to well based on whether this exists or not to check if new exists or this folder

04:08.810 --> 04:13.500
exists and if not create it right.

04:14.370 --> 04:18.620
So if this doesn't exist we have to create the folder so we can put the images in.

04:18.930 --> 04:28.180
And then finally while we want to do here and this is the tough part we want to loop through this entire

04:28.180 --> 04:42.880
folder so loop through pocket X and then we want to convert images to G.

04:43.100 --> 04:48.480
And then finally we want to save them to the new folder.

04:48.500 --> 04:49.460
This is a tough one.

04:49.460 --> 04:52.480
It combines a lot of the things that we've learned up until now.

04:52.640 --> 04:57.380
You might not get it right away because it is a little tricky so don't worry.

04:57.380 --> 05:01.430
In the next video I'm going to show you how to solve this problem.

05:01.850 --> 05:05.170
But why you might want to learn is how to google.

05:05.240 --> 05:09.090
First of all how do you sis to grab the first and second argument.

05:09.260 --> 05:19.400
How to use the OS module to grab the path so that you can say hey I want these files in pocket X and

05:19.400 --> 05:22.230
I want to write to this new file.

05:22.340 --> 05:28.070
So we're gonna use the OS module for that and then obviously we're gonna use the pillow module to convert

05:28.070 --> 05:34.590
the images to PMG something that we've seen before this exercise is going to require a bit of googling

05:35.010 --> 05:37.890
on your case which is a good skill to develop.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.930
So in the next video I'm going to show you how to do this.

05:40.380 --> 05:41.250
I'll see you on that one.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.260
Good luck.
