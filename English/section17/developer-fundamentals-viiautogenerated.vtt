00:00.270 --> 00:05.880
Let's talk about a key developer fundamentals we haven't seen one in a while so I hope you're excited

00:05.880 --> 00:06.600
to see another one.

00:07.320 --> 00:08.100
What is it.

00:08.100 --> 00:12.130
This one is pick the right library.

00:12.210 --> 00:14.160
What do you mean by this.

00:14.160 --> 00:18.040
Well let's have a look at what we just installed in the previous video.

00:18.390 --> 00:26.270
We installed this library called pillow which allows us to manipulate images using Python but I also

00:26.270 --> 00:28.950
mentioned that there's a couple of warnings here.

00:29.090 --> 00:35.530
It says Hey pillow and pill cannot coexist in the same environment before installing pillow Please uninstall

00:35.630 --> 00:37.060
pill.

00:37.070 --> 00:40.600
We also have some version warnings as well.

00:40.690 --> 00:42.460
So what does this mean.

00:42.460 --> 00:50.600
Well if I go back to the main page over here we see that pillow is a is the friendly pill for by this

00:50.600 --> 00:54.110
person and pill is the python Image Library.

00:54.110 --> 00:58.430
What does this all mean when you pick a library that you want to use.

00:58.460 --> 01:01.880
And trust me you're gonna do a lot of that in your career.

01:01.880 --> 01:07.850
You want to make sure that you pick either the latest most modern library but also the library that

01:07.850 --> 01:09.540
the most people use.

01:09.860 --> 01:12.500
And we've mentioned this before when using pipes.

01:12.620 --> 01:13.080
Right.

01:13.100 --> 01:17.550
We want to make sure that the library we use has a lot of community support.

01:17.600 --> 01:22.850
It's constantly being updated so that there's no security issues or it's not a library.

01:22.850 --> 01:26.480
That's not very well because anybody can publish a library.

01:26.660 --> 01:33.590
When you look at python Image Library which is the original one that we used to have and this is a Wikipedia

01:33.590 --> 01:35.310
article that I can link to.

01:35.510 --> 01:40.730
And again this is something that you'll just have to learn to develop the skill of finding the right

01:40.730 --> 01:41.840
library.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.630
So in here we actually see that Python Image Library.

01:44.630 --> 01:55.320
So originally it was called Pil and this library existed and was very popular but when Python 3 came

01:55.320 --> 01:59.300
out pill didn't support this newer version of Python.

01:59.340 --> 02:05.850
So essentially what happened was it was forked and forked simply means it was essentially copied because

02:05.850 --> 02:13.440
it was an open source library and developed into pillow by another developer which gives us Python 3

02:13.530 --> 02:16.590
support so that's what it means.

02:16.590 --> 02:21.510
It's a pill fork that allows us to have Python 3 support.

02:21.700 --> 02:28.830
The key here being that again we want to make sure that we use a libraries that are up to date that

02:28.830 --> 02:35.460
work with Python 3 but also libraries like pillow here that have a lot of community support.

02:35.460 --> 02:39.480
If I go to get hub here we see that it has six thousand four hundred stars.

02:39.510 --> 02:45.450
It's been forked a thousand two hundred times and it's also used by one hundred and fifty thousand developers.

02:45.450 --> 02:47.330
That's a pretty good sign.

02:47.340 --> 02:55.230
We also see that the latest commit happened this year which is awesome.

02:55.230 --> 03:01.710
Again developing that skill to pick the right library is a sign of an experienced developer.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.460
So there you go.

03:03.570 --> 03:05.640
Another developer fundamentals.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.340
Let's get back to building some projects in the next video.
