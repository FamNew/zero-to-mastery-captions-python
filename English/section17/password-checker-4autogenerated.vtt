00:00.540 --> 00:03.640
We've just built our password checker.

00:03.720 --> 00:05.640
It's pretty cool right.

00:05.640 --> 00:10.680
I guarantee you this is something that if you start talking about it during an interview the interviewer

00:10.680 --> 00:18.300
is going to be pretty impressed because it does have some pretty advanced topics but hopefully this

00:18.300 --> 00:24.540
whole process made sense and you now have a tool that works and that he can even check your passwords

00:24.810 --> 00:28.040
to make sure that you're being secure online now.

00:28.170 --> 00:34.020
A bit of a caution here that I want to note is that right now we're entering the passwords in the command

00:34.020 --> 00:34.690
line.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.870
I'm using something called a fish shell.

00:36.870 --> 00:43.810
You may have different shells or programs running here that sometimes actually save these commands.

00:43.840 --> 00:49.410
If you remember if I press an app I wrote here you see that I get my passwords back.

00:49.450 --> 00:52.870
So somewhere on my computer this is being saved.

00:52.900 --> 00:57.760
Maybe that's not super secure because somebody might have or acquire access to it.

00:58.940 --> 01:06.710
So a good way to perhaps for you to improve this program is to read these passwords from a text file

01:06.770 --> 01:09.470
instead of a command line argument.

01:09.470 --> 01:15.270
But I'll leave that up to you because by now you should know how to do that the final thing I want to

01:15.270 --> 01:19.560
do is just add over here at the bottom.

01:19.560 --> 01:29.310
Since this should be our main module to just say if underscore underscore name equals main so only run

01:29.640 --> 01:30.720
this file.

01:30.780 --> 01:39.000
If it's the main file being run from the command line and not if it's being imported so in here if I

01:39.090 --> 01:39.690
run this

01:42.640 --> 01:48.910
this still works but we make sure that this file is only going to be run if it's the main file being

01:48.910 --> 01:50.070
run.

01:50.080 --> 01:58.090
Now another neat thing that you can do as well is you can also do sis dot exit to exit the process in

01:58.090 --> 01:58.620
case.

01:58.810 --> 02:03.400
Well in case for some reason this doesn't exit.

02:03.400 --> 02:08.410
Just to make sure that the system call actually exit and brings us back to the command line.

02:08.830 --> 02:15.150
So again if I save this there you go everything is still working.

02:15.150 --> 02:23.670
The only difference that you'll see here is that we have the done being returned vs. over here where

02:23.670 --> 02:28.240
it wasn't because we're exiting out of this file.

02:28.290 --> 02:34.190
So this entire check my pass python file was run and at the end of it all.

02:34.230 --> 02:38.610
What does this entire function this main function return.

02:38.610 --> 02:45.420
Well it returns done so we exit the entire process and we get the return value of done.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.280
There we go ladies and gentlemen.

02:47.280 --> 02:51.530
We've completed our check my pass project.

02:51.700 --> 02:54.210
Now I've told you this is my favorite project.

02:54.220 --> 02:57.890
That doesn't mean that the rest of the projects are going to suck throughout the course.

02:57.910 --> 02:58.780
I don't think they do.

02:58.780 --> 03:05.070
I'm just saying this is a pretty cool one but I get excited about things like this anyway.

03:05.090 --> 03:11.300
Share your work show this off to your parents your friends your family your employer and I'll see you

03:11.570 --> 03:12.640
for the next one.

03:12.740 --> 03:12.970
Debbie.
