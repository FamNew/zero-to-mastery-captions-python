00:00.790 --> 00:01.360
All right.

00:01.520 --> 00:02.350
I'm back.

00:02.360 --> 00:08.840
That took a lot longer than I expected so I changed my sleep time to three hundred and for some reason

00:09.020 --> 00:13.160
while I was running the script that user decided to unfollow me.

00:13.220 --> 00:18.390
So we had to select a different user which was a jasmine.

00:18.980 --> 00:25.670
And I also added a break statement in here so that it didn't keep looping again it was taking forever

00:25.670 --> 00:28.150
so I just did a little shortcut here.

00:28.280 --> 00:31.490
Now hopefully I have followed back.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.180
Let's have a look.

00:33.210 --> 00:33.420
All right.

00:33.420 --> 00:37.990
Looks like I have an extra and Yep look at that.

00:38.110 --> 00:45.200
I have this person I've just followed her back so you can see how this might be useful.

00:45.260 --> 00:49.970
You might just follow everybody and remove this if statement.

00:49.970 --> 00:55.520
Maybe you're a little pretentious and you only want to follow back people based on their follow counts

00:55.760 --> 01:06.930
so you might want to do something like If follower dot followers count is let's say higher than a hundred

01:07.310 --> 01:09.050
then you follow back.

01:09.050 --> 01:12.460
So there's a lot of things that you can do here but that's pretty cool.

01:12.470 --> 01:19.100
We created our first bought the generous but in the next video.

01:19.100 --> 01:28.290
I want to do a another little fun tool what we call a narcissist but so let's see how that works in

01:28.290 --> 01:28.880
the next video.
