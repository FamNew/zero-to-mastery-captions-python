Welcome back.

00:01.650 --> 00:09.120
In this video we're going to try a little exercise and I actually want you to try this yourself and

00:09.120 --> 00:11.620
in the next video I'll show you the solution.

00:11.610 --> 00:18.750
Now I've attached here a watermark PDA if you can see over here that it says draft and it's just one

00:18.750 --> 00:23.740
page like this now you'll find this in your resources.

00:23.740 --> 00:29.570
But I want to build a tool that's quite useful that watermarks all my files.

00:29.650 --> 00:36.010
So remember the Super dot PDA file we made in the last video that had four pages.

00:36.010 --> 00:38.560
Well I want to watermark this all of them.

00:38.620 --> 00:45.070
So instead of me doing manually let's say we had thousands of pages I want a program that can watermark

00:45.520 --> 00:46.820
my PDX.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.370
Now why would this be useful.

00:49.390 --> 00:55.020
Well in Hollywood this is actually a useful thing to be able to do.

00:55.120 --> 01:02.750
Let's say you're working on a TV show let's call it lost and you want to give the script which is super

01:02.750 --> 01:08.140
secret because you don't want the audience to find out what happens in the show to your cast members

01:08.440 --> 01:15.310
and all these actors that are going to get a draft of the script but we don't want them to leak the

01:15.310 --> 01:18.240
script to the press so that everybody finds out about it.

01:18.250 --> 01:18.900
Right.

01:18.910 --> 01:25.370
So usually big companies in Hollywood watermark their script with usually an actor's name.

01:25.390 --> 01:33.190
So if that actor leaks the script well they'll know that that person has their name on the script and

01:33.190 --> 01:35.010
they're the ones that leaked it.

01:35.020 --> 01:38.380
So this is actually a useful thing to know.

01:38.420 --> 01:39.560
So how can we do this.

01:41.180 --> 01:44.160
Well this is your challenge right.

01:44.210 --> 01:51.830
What we want to do is ideally use the water dot PD f that I'll provide for you.

01:51.830 --> 02:00.530
I want to write this water dot PD F on all the pages of super dot PD f that we combined in the previous

02:00.530 --> 02:01.100
lesson.

02:01.100 --> 02:10.340
Or you can have your own PDUFA so using what we've learned up until now and the Pew IPD F2 library.

02:10.460 --> 02:12.470
Let's see if we can give that a go.

02:12.650 --> 02:15.860
And in the next video I'll show you how I did it.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.440
I'll see in the next one by.
