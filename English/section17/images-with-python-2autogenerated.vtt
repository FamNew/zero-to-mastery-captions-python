00:00.150 --> 00:04.530
Let's learn a few more neat things that we can do with images now.

00:04.530 --> 00:09.420
Here we learned that we're able to save images we can convert them.

00:09.570 --> 00:16.800
We can add image filters to them and we also learn that we can actually use this save method to give

00:16.830 --> 00:23.130
a new name to a file and then also give it an extension with the second parameter so we can convert

00:23.130 --> 00:31.850
from let's say a Jay back to a PMG file like this another neat thing that we can do is also actually

00:31.850 --> 00:36.710
do something called Show and this is just going to show us the image.

00:36.710 --> 00:39.820
Let me show you huh.

00:39.830 --> 00:40.790
Get that done.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.350
Let me show you.

00:42.440 --> 00:42.770
All right.

00:42.770 --> 00:44.150
There you go.

00:44.150 --> 00:50.860
We see that it's now opening up the file and showing me the great out black and white 1920s Pikachu

00:54.320 --> 01:05.390
we can also rotate our images so I can say filtered image and this image I want to rotate let's say

01:05.480 --> 01:12.760
90 degrees and I'm actually going to move this above the safe so that we can see the effects.

01:12.820 --> 01:17.870
I run this and go to gray dot PSG

01:20.500 --> 01:30.220
and let's just assign this to a crooked variable and this crooked variable which stores the new image

01:31.120 --> 01:33.430
is where we're going to save.

01:33.430 --> 01:34.820
So let's just loops.

01:34.870 --> 01:43.480
Let's save that and run this and if we now go to gray dot BMG look at that we got a crooked picture.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.490
And we can again do different things let's do a 180.

01:46.490 --> 01:50.910
So we have upside down to get you and there we go.

01:50.930 --> 01:52.870
We have upside down pikachu.

01:52.880 --> 01:53.720
So that's great.

01:53.720 --> 01:59.020
We can rotate images we can also resize the images.

01:59.110 --> 02:06.010
So let's just say resize here and this is going to be called resize and instead of rotate what we'll

02:06.010 --> 02:15.390
say is we'll say resize and we can say that this image you remember it was 640 by 640.

02:15.420 --> 02:25.570
I'm going to resize it to three hundred by three hundred so a nice little thumbnail if I run this up

02:25.660 --> 02:33.040
and you see that I get an error here and what I actually should have done here is the resize accepts

02:33.070 --> 02:34.450
a couple.

02:34.450 --> 02:38.280
So I have to add brackets around here.

02:38.500 --> 02:45.560
So if I run this again let me clear and run this again and we go to great PMG.

02:45.660 --> 02:49.530
Look at that Pikachu is a lot smaller than he used to be.

02:49.650 --> 02:56.940
Pikachu is tiny now so we got tiny Great out Pikachu so that's great.

02:56.950 --> 03:01.660
I can resize images which is really really useful.

03:01.670 --> 03:05.730
Now let's say I wanted to crop my Peek At You image.

03:05.980 --> 03:07.260
What can we do.

03:07.270 --> 03:14.560
Well instead of me telling you let's just find out we can go to the documentation Web site and simply

03:14.560 --> 03:15.850
search for crop

03:18.530 --> 03:21.520
and if we keep scrolling down creep scrolling down.

03:21.510 --> 03:29.160
Well let's just do dot crop to see if there's an actual function that we have and let's go over here

03:29.550 --> 03:36.310
and we see that we have a crop over here so cutting pasting and merging images.

03:36.360 --> 03:36.630
OK.

03:36.660 --> 03:39.900
So let me just zoom in so you can see it a little bit.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.190
We see exactly how it can work.

03:43.190 --> 03:51.130
We can just pick the pixel location of the four corners and crop an image.

03:51.150 --> 03:55.400
So let's just copy that and try it out.

03:55.420 --> 03:57.940
So we have the region.

03:57.940 --> 04:06.460
So let's just say region or let's just remove this and crop the filtered image.

04:08.070 --> 04:20.680
With the box like this and if we save this region image and run our code let's go to peek at you and

04:20.680 --> 04:22.630
look at that just the face of picture.

04:22.630 --> 04:26.420
He's so cute all right.

04:26.980 --> 04:28.540
Let's pretend that I didn't make that voice.

04:28.540 --> 04:29.200
Let's keep going.

04:29.980 --> 04:31.180
So there we have it.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.820
We can even crop images.

04:32.830 --> 04:34.950
I mean this is pretty basic stuff.

04:34.960 --> 04:40.870
But you see the power of image processing whatever you want to do you're not going to know at the top

04:40.870 --> 04:41.530
of your head.

04:41.530 --> 04:47.560
Instead you're gonna go to the documentation and say hey I want to have a blurry Great out image.

04:47.560 --> 04:48.360
How can I do that.

04:48.370 --> 04:54.710
Well you just search the documentation page and learn the commands and you write your file.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.110
And that's the key right.

04:56.140 --> 05:02.170
You're not going to know the top of your head the entire library when the need arises.

05:02.170 --> 05:04.000
You just read the documentation.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.290
That's what good developers do.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.170
All right.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.990
We've learned a lot but we still have a few more things to learn.

05:10.140 --> 05:13.120
So let's take a break and I'll see you in the next one.

05:13.240 --> 05:13.430
Bobby.
