00:00.480 --> 00:03.390
Let's send our first e-mail now.

00:03.450 --> 00:08.130
This requires a lot of configuration that again you'll just have to get used to.

00:08.130 --> 00:10.140
So if it looks overwhelming Don't worry.

00:10.140 --> 00:14.550
Once you have this basic setup you can send any type of e-mail you want.

00:14.580 --> 00:23.170
So the first thing we're gonna do is I'm going to say email is going to equal this e-mail message that

00:23.170 --> 00:26.680
I just imported this e-mail message.

00:26.680 --> 00:39.140
Class and this is going to be our email object from here we can add to this object the from key which

00:39.140 --> 00:41.060
will be hey who is this e-mail from.

00:41.060 --> 00:44.210
This e-mail is going to be from myself from Andre Nagai

00:46.810 --> 00:55.550
next is Who is this e-mail going to be to Well this e-mail is going to be too.

00:55.750 --> 01:01.540
Well let's say Andre at 0 2 mastery dot Io.

01:01.660 --> 01:11.860
So we want to send that e-mail to this e-mail address and then the e-mail subject line will say what

01:11.860 --> 01:16.290
should we say let's create the worst spammy e-mail possible.

01:16.330 --> 01:17.610
I think this will be funny.

01:17.710 --> 01:24.450
Let's say you won a million dollars.

01:24.500 --> 01:25.070
There you go.

01:25.130 --> 01:30.160
That's a spammy subject line that's for sure so that's our subject.

01:30.160 --> 01:40.240
The next thing we're going to do is say Email dot set content method which essentially says what's the

01:40.240 --> 01:41.820
content of the email.

01:42.190 --> 01:47.410
In our case let's just say I am a python master.

01:47.410 --> 01:51.950
Now in here we can actually set any type of content we want.

01:52.090 --> 01:53.220
We can do text.

01:53.260 --> 01:55.930
We can do HDMI all we can do images.

01:55.930 --> 01:57.540
We're going to get to that a little bit later on.

01:57.880 --> 02:00.610
But for now this is fine.

02:00.620 --> 02:01.390
There you go.

02:01.400 --> 02:06.030
That's our email object with the from two subject and content.

02:06.110 --> 02:10.010
We have our email but we need to send it right.

02:10.940 --> 02:21.680
So what we need to do is to use this SMP server to log in to our Gmail client and then send that email

02:21.740 --> 02:22.490
from there.

02:23.190 --> 02:35.060
So all we're going to do is say with S.M. T.P. lib dot SMP and in here we're going to say what is going

02:35.060 --> 02:37.010
to be our SMP server.

02:37.010 --> 02:42.680
And the reason I got you to create a Gmail account is just so you can follow along because this is going

02:42.680 --> 02:50.100
to be custom to whatever email client you're using in our case we want our host to be Gmail.

02:50.180 --> 02:56.490
So I'm going to say S.M. tepee dot gmail dot com.

02:56.540 --> 03:06.850
This is going to be our host and then this SMP is going to be running on pt. 5 8 7 again.

03:06.860 --> 03:08.970
You don't have to know this exactly.

03:09.260 --> 03:16.100
If we go back to SMP you see over here that typically submit I'm going e-mail to the mail server on

03:16.160 --> 03:17.550
Port 587.

03:17.620 --> 03:19.970
Remember at some TB is a protocol.

03:19.970 --> 03:25.490
It's a standard for machines to communicate with each other by using port 587.

03:25.520 --> 03:30.220
It's just a standard way for SMP server to be run.

03:30.430 --> 03:35.410
Like I said this is one of those things that you can usually just google around and copy and paste because

03:35.770 --> 03:38.820
it's going to be the same if you have a different client than G.M..

03:38.830 --> 03:45.470
Then again you can google and see what type of host you need in our case let's continue here.

03:45.500 --> 03:55.800
We're going to say with this host as S.M. T.P. because we're going to use this now let's make this a

03:55.800 --> 04:00.010
little bit bigger so you can see an in here.

04:00.020 --> 04:04.610
This is the part that's going to look confusing but again it's just you do it once and once you do it

04:04.790 --> 04:07.660
you have an e-mail server they can use.

04:07.760 --> 04:12.010
I'm going to say as empty dot E H L O.

04:12.050 --> 04:18.440
Kind of looks like hello but it's not Hello this is actually part of the protocol of the S M TB.

04:18.470 --> 04:25.340
Again the agreement it starts with a little hello message that well it's type like this you can actually

04:25.340 --> 04:29.610
Google why this method is like this and not actually says hello.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.880
It's actually a pretty funny story.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.650
So we have a 70 B Hello So that's the initial hey this is a server I'm awake.

04:38.650 --> 04:40.360
Hello message.

04:40.400 --> 04:52.420
Next we do the SMP dot start T L S and tell us is an encryption mechanism.

04:52.630 --> 04:56.830
So we want to connect securely to the server.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.220
And now this is the critical part.

04:59.260 --> 05:03.040
Up until this point you might be confused as to what we're actually doing here.

05:03.130 --> 05:12.730
We're essentially with this next line we're going to connect to this email account this G.M. account

05:12.730 --> 05:20.560
that I created so that instead of me opening this page hitting compose and writing that email that we

05:20.560 --> 05:24.240
already wrote I can do it from code.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.650
So what am I going to do.

05:25.730 --> 05:32.860
I'm going to say S.M. T.P. dot log in and I'm going to log in with my credentials.

05:32.870 --> 05:39.230
So the first one is going to be this dummy e-mail that I created which is 0 2 mastery one at gmail dot

05:39.230 --> 05:40.460
com.

05:40.460 --> 05:46.470
And next is going to be the password that I used for this log in.

05:46.670 --> 05:52.730
Again this is something that because I've created a dummy account I don't mind sharing it with you.

05:52.790 --> 05:59.540
The password is Hello ziti am my old friend

06:02.780 --> 06:09.050
so this way I'm able to log in to this server and guess what we're doing next.

06:09.050 --> 06:13.730
Well next we're going to say Send message.

06:13.910 --> 06:18.810
And we're going to send where we're going to send this whole email that we've created.

06:18.860 --> 06:29.930
So let's do e-mail and just for fun at the end we'll say print all good boss.

06:29.940 --> 06:30.360
There we go.

06:31.110 --> 06:35.190
Now if we didn't make any errors this should actually work.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.510
Let's give it a go.

06:36.510 --> 06:44.590
I'm going to say Python 3 and then run our email sender dot pi.

06:44.730 --> 06:46.290
I want to give you a warning here.

06:46.290 --> 06:52.270
If you've named your PI file e-mail dot pi this actually might give you an error.

06:52.290 --> 06:55.660
So make sure you name it something other than email dot pi.

06:55.710 --> 06:57.160
Let's give it a go.

06:57.180 --> 07:00.740
There's a bit of a pause and we have all good boss.

07:00.840 --> 07:07.500
There was a pause here because we had to connect to our server log in to our account and then send the

07:07.530 --> 07:09.750
e-mail and then all good boss.

07:09.780 --> 07:12.450
So it looks like this code worked.

07:12.630 --> 07:13.690
So let's test it out.

07:13.710 --> 07:19.210
I logged in to this dummy account and I sent an e-mail to Andre at 0 2 mastery data.

07:19.290 --> 07:22.860
Oh let's check that e-mail account and look at that.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.830
You won a million dollars.

07:24.840 --> 07:32.720
I am a python master from the e-mail address of our dummy account.

07:32.740 --> 07:38.110
Now I actually had to pull this out of the spam folder because it was marked as spam because well it

07:38.110 --> 07:43.250
definitely looks like spammy email so that's awesome.

07:43.250 --> 07:47.020
We're just able to send an e-mail through python.

07:47.030 --> 07:52.580
How cool is that in the next video we're going to explore this a little bit more and make this a little

07:52.580 --> 07:58.010
bit more dynamic so we can customize it to each individual that we send e-mail to.

07:58.850 --> 08:00.170
I'll see you on the next one.

08:00.170 --> 08:00.620
Bye bye.
