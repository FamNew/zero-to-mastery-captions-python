00:00.890 --> 00:02.130
Welcome back.

00:02.180 --> 00:04.750
How are we going to build this stool.

00:04.760 --> 00:09.470
How are we going to know what passwords have been hacked and what does it really mean anyway.

00:11.070 --> 00:14.050
Well passwords get leaked all the time.

00:14.160 --> 00:16.620
We've heard about data breaches right.

00:16.620 --> 00:21.660
Facebook has been hacked with data breaches Equifax linked in Yahoo.

00:21.660 --> 00:28.800
All these big companies sometimes get their databases leaked and essentially what happens sometimes

00:28.920 --> 00:34.460
is are usernames and passwords get leaked to the public.

00:34.650 --> 00:42.630
And hackers what they do is they compile these lists of leaked usernames and passwords and essentially

00:42.630 --> 00:46.760
try to log in to different services.

00:46.860 --> 00:54.030
So there are databases or you can't think of them as massive Excel files of all emails and passwords

00:54.060 --> 00:57.660
that have ever been leaked throughout history.

00:57.660 --> 01:04.980
And there's actually a Web site created by somebody called Troy Hunt who's a very famous security researcher.

01:05.160 --> 01:11.520
And it's called Have I been Ponte and what you can do here is you can actually enter your email address

01:11.670 --> 01:15.500
and say let's go Andy at gmail dot com.

01:15.540 --> 01:18.980
Has this ever been leaked Oh no.

01:19.000 --> 01:27.430
It looks like it's been porn so it looks like it's been pawned on 88 breached sites and found 27 pastes

01:28.430 --> 01:33.980
what this means essentially is that this email has been part of a data breach.

01:34.010 --> 01:39.480
So maybe I used this e-mail as my Facebook log in.

01:39.500 --> 01:45.770
Well when Facebook got hacked and some users maybe stole user information.

01:45.770 --> 01:53.880
Well this email was part of it as a matter of fact out of for 88 breaches and if I go to passwords here

01:54.360 --> 01:56.970
you can actually do the same thing about passwords.

01:57.180 --> 02:01.050
I can check my password and you can see over here that it doesn't show.

02:01.180 --> 02:04.380
And I can click over here to see if it's been popped.

02:04.410 --> 02:09.000
Now I just enter some gibberish here and it looks like no no punished found.

02:09.060 --> 02:10.530
But why does this matter.

02:10.530 --> 02:17.190
Why do we care that e mails and passwords have been leaked hackers who use something called dictionary

02:17.190 --> 02:20.100
attacks a dictionary attack.

02:20.190 --> 02:28.950
Well kind of like a Python dictionary uses a massive dictionary with the key and value of let's say

02:28.950 --> 02:37.950
a username and password and just tries to log into Web sites using these massive lists of information

02:39.970 --> 02:42.820
and if your username and password has ever been leaked.

02:42.850 --> 02:50.320
Well a hacker simply runs what's called a brute force attack where it just loops through all these leaked

02:50.320 --> 02:52.960
usernames and passwords and tries to log in.

02:52.960 --> 02:58.900
So maybe going into Facebook and just looping through this massive list eventually they're going to

02:58.900 --> 03:02.090
hit something and be able to log in.

03:02.120 --> 03:06.840
Now here's the thing this isn't a web development course.

03:06.890 --> 03:12.830
I mean this course is about Python and although we have a section on web development what I can tell

03:12.830 --> 03:18.830
you is that most of the time even though I trust this Web site it uses something called HDD P.S. which

03:18.830 --> 03:27.360
is encrypted I or you should never really trust a Web site with your password.

03:27.360 --> 03:36.000
Yes maybe a big Web site like Facebook maybe Google we trust but ideally you don't want to send your

03:36.000 --> 03:43.700
password like this over the Internet because what's happening here as soon as I click this is that it's

03:43.700 --> 03:46.460
being transferred to a server somewhere in the world.

03:46.550 --> 03:50.780
It's traveling through the Internet wires and somebody could intercept it.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.520
So there's actually a more secure way of doing this.

03:54.560 --> 04:02.090
And this is why we're going to build this Web site actually gives us a password API for us to do this

04:02.120 --> 04:03.470
and check our passwords.

04:03.470 --> 04:11.540
But in a more secure way because sure we might trust this Web site but the best security is to trust

04:11.750 --> 04:12.340
no one.

04:12.440 --> 04:18.890
Right now what I'm about to show you and why we're going to do is actually a technique used by legitimate

04:18.890 --> 04:21.670
password managers like keeper one password.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.890
You might have heard of Blur sticky password.

04:24.890 --> 04:28.920
These are expensive password managers that keep your passwords secure.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.180
But we're going to build that ourselves because we're programmers.

04:32.330 --> 04:39.680
So in the next video we're actually going to start coding a bit and learning about this passwords API.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.760
I'll see in the next one by.
