WEBVTT

00:00.990 --> 00:02.130
Welcome back.

00:02.160 --> 00:04.380
Let's build our Twitter board.

00:04.380 --> 00:08.860
The first thing we want to do is import T.P. library.

00:09.090 --> 00:12.060
And obviously this isn't a built in module in Python.

00:12.150 --> 00:24.750
So we'll have to install it by saying Pip three install TV and this is going to install the TB library.

00:24.740 --> 00:26.200
Awesome.

00:26.220 --> 00:29.580
Now this library has really good documentation.

00:29.670 --> 00:35.550
So when we go to read the docs I'll actually show you hey how to get started and give you some quick

00:35.670 --> 00:38.210
start up and setup that we need to do.

00:38.400 --> 00:46.140
In my case I'm just going to copy the hello TB code that they provided for us and just paste it in here.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.720
Now there's a few things happening here.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.470
Obviously we don't need the double imports.

00:50.510 --> 00:58.250
What we can see here is that we need to authenticate that is we use the 2P o off handler and we have

00:58.250 --> 01:05.640
to give it something called a Consumer key and a consumer secret and then we also have to set access

01:05.650 --> 01:10.760
token with the access token and access token secret.

01:10.770 --> 01:19.090
Now what this is is this is what the Twitter API uses to verify our account.

01:19.150 --> 01:24.300
You remember how we had to create an account here and get authenticated because not just anybody can

01:24.300 --> 01:25.440
use the Twitter API.

01:25.890 --> 01:27.360
Well this is what they're asking for.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.950
They're saying hey I want you to verify that this is you.

01:31.050 --> 01:35.700
If you're accessing the Twitter API I want to know who's accessing that data.

01:35.700 --> 01:41.790
So in your case after you've created an app you just click on details and you see here that we have

01:41.790 --> 01:44.490
keys and tokens these keys.

01:44.490 --> 01:50.640
I'm actually going to regenerate after this because you don't want to share these with anybody but I'll

01:50.940 --> 01:52.800
at least show you how these works.

01:52.800 --> 01:58.650
So that for yourself you'll have different keys and API keys and secrets that you have that you'll have

01:58.650 --> 01:59.800
to copy and paste.

01:59.970 --> 02:02.060
Luckily it tells us exactly what they are.

02:02.070 --> 02:11.250
We have the API key which is the consumer key well posted in here as a string.

02:11.440 --> 02:17.000
And then we have the API secret key which is the consumer.

02:17.030 --> 02:26.690
Secret which will paste it in their let's make this a little bit bigger so you can see and then we have

02:26.690 --> 02:30.630
the access token and the access token secret again.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.030
We copy the access token

02:35.940 --> 02:42.410
pasted in here and the secret.

02:42.430 --> 02:49.000
So again these are the keys that Twitter API is going to be able to use to identify you but you don't

02:49.000 --> 02:54.750
want to share these with anybody even though I'm showing it to everybody like I said after this video

02:54.780 --> 02:56.060
I'm just going to regenerate.

02:56.070 --> 03:05.990
So that while you won't be able to use my keys after we've set up this off object we then use the T.P.

03:06.110 --> 03:14.290
dot API to authenticate and we now have access to the API so let's check this out.

03:14.290 --> 03:23.290
I have my public tweets and I can grab those by saying API dot home timeline and then I'm going to loop

03:23.350 --> 03:30.920
over these tweets the public tweets and just print tweet dot text so let's try this out.

03:33.260 --> 03:37.460
Things never work the first time around so we'll see.

03:37.520 --> 03:47.220
I'm going to run Python 3 and say tweet tweet dot by.

03:47.430 --> 03:48.240
All right.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.120
Look at that.

03:49.230 --> 04:01.930
We've actually no heirs gotten the tweets from the home timeline and specifically from my Twitter home

04:01.930 --> 04:02.830
timeline.

04:02.830 --> 04:04.240
So we see a here we have.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.920
Let's see what we have.

04:05.950 --> 04:11.440
We have a re tweet an overview of the best newsletters that I know of for front end developers including

04:11.440 --> 04:12.740
General front and JavaScript.

04:12.760 --> 04:13.580
Yes yes.

04:13.630 --> 04:18.550
I hope this person included my newsletter by the way I have a newsletter in case you're wondering every

04:18.550 --> 04:18.850
month.

04:19.180 --> 04:20.200
But let's check this.

04:20.230 --> 04:23.040
If I go to my home Hey look at that.

04:23.140 --> 04:28.630
An overview of the best newsletters that I know for front end developers Brian Rinaldi.

04:28.630 --> 04:31.600
I hope my newsletters included but there you go.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.300
That's our timeline right there.

04:33.580 --> 04:36.540
And we're able to access the Twitter API.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.680
That was pretty easy right.

04:38.680 --> 04:44.860
Not that again I keep saying this I know I'm repetitive but this is the power of Python.

04:44.950 --> 04:46.900
There are just so many libraries.

04:46.960 --> 04:54.550
Such a large community and it's so easy to create things already just by looking at this T.P. library

04:54.580 --> 04:58.240
you probably can think of different things that you can do with Twitter.

04:58.300 --> 05:00.720
Like I said the world is your oyster.

05:00.730 --> 05:05.870
That's why python is such a popular language let's get back to this.

05:06.010 --> 05:10.610
So we have some tweets but let's do something exciting here.

05:10.630 --> 05:14.290
What else does the Twitter API give us.

05:14.290 --> 05:21.810
Well let's remove these public tweets for now and just print out let's say API dot me.

05:22.150 --> 05:25.940
And this is actually going to give the information about myself.

05:26.170 --> 05:35.250
So let's actually give this a variable saying user so and I'm going to say API dot me and this is going

05:35.250 --> 05:38.810
to give information about the user in my case.

05:38.820 --> 05:41.160
Let's just do user dot name.

05:41.370 --> 05:45.090
And again this is something that you can check for yourself on their documentation.

05:45.090 --> 05:47.910
And if I run this.

05:48.040 --> 05:48.640
There you go.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.690
That's my name.

05:49.690 --> 05:50.870
That's my Twitter username.

05:51.700 --> 05:51.970
OK.

05:52.000 --> 05:52.900
What else do we have.

05:52.900 --> 05:55.120
We have.

05:55.120 --> 06:03.600
Well the actual screen name which will be my Twitter handle right here.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.750
Andre Agassi with no spaces.

06:05.950 --> 06:12.930
And then let's just do what else can we do we can also do followers count again.

06:13.060 --> 06:17.440
These are all on the tweet B API that you can check for yourself.

06:17.470 --> 06:18.460
Fi do this

06:21.890 --> 06:23.010
Hey look at that.

06:23.060 --> 06:28.850
It's actually pretty crazy that I have 10000 followers not trying to show off or anything but it's crazy

06:28.850 --> 06:31.300
I barely tweet in somehow 10000.

06:31.310 --> 06:33.690
So thank you for the follow.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.690
Not sure how useful my tweets are but I appreciate the photos.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.110
That's pretty cool.

06:39.110 --> 06:43.390
But you know what I want to start building something useful with my Twitter board.

06:43.460 --> 06:46.560
So in the next video we're going to do just that.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.190
I'll see you on that one by.
