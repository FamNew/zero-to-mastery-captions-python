Let's talk about scripting but what do I really mean by scripting.

00:06.100 --> 00:13.750
This is just a general term to say that while we're writing scripts scripts using Python to do something

00:13.750 --> 00:22.080
for us to use the power of the machines to help us be more productive more efficient so this section

00:22.110 --> 00:24.890
is all about making our lives easier.

00:24.900 --> 00:31.050
Understanding what the power of Python is what we've learned up until now and how we can use it to make

00:31.080 --> 00:33.020
our lives easier.

00:33.030 --> 00:36.960
We're going to learn about processing images really efficiently.

00:36.990 --> 00:40.800
We're going to learn about working with files like PDX.

00:40.890 --> 00:46.040
We're going to learn how to send e-mails with Python even text messages.

00:46.050 --> 00:48.320
We're going to build a Twitter board.

00:48.390 --> 00:53.490
We're also going to build projects along the way to show you all the cool things we can do with Python.

00:53.490 --> 00:59.850
My favorite project that we're going to build is a super secure password checker to see if our passwords

00:59.850 --> 01:00.960
have ever been hacked.

01:00.960 --> 01:07.740
It's a really really neat project but the idea here is that with python using all these libraries and

01:07.740 --> 01:12.930
modules that have been built by the Python community we can do so much.

01:12.930 --> 01:20.020
So it's going to be a really exciting section and it's going to open up a whole world of possibilities.

01:20.070 --> 01:24.870
Molly going to scratch the surface but I guarantee you by the end of it you're going to be really really

01:24.870 --> 01:29.450
excited and truly understand the power of Python.

01:29.460 --> 01:30.110
Let's get started.
