00:00.740 --> 00:07.390
You've just learned about image processing and image processing is similar to video processing.

00:07.430 --> 00:15.640
They're both essentially analyzing a frame of an image and doing something with that data.

00:15.650 --> 00:17.790
So where do you go from here.

00:17.840 --> 00:23.720
Well we can use libraries like pillow which are really great for simple images or you can use something

00:23.720 --> 00:29.250
like open CV and open CV is a very powerful library.

00:29.300 --> 00:35.680
As a matter of fact open CV is used with machine learning like self-driving car.

00:35.780 --> 00:41.090
You can see over here somebody built an open CV Python neural network autonomous RC car.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.020
Yes.

00:42.140 --> 00:49.430
What we learned although is just scratching the surface leads us to learn about autonomous driving and

00:49.430 --> 00:50.490
machine learning.

00:50.510 --> 00:53.020
Now we have a section on machine learning in this course.

00:53.030 --> 00:54.530
So we're going to dive deeper into that.

00:55.010 --> 01:02.300
But with this newfound knowledge you can even explore libraries like open CV if you're interested in

01:02.300 --> 01:10.940
this topic to learn how to analyze images and how to maybe use machine learning to do exciting things

01:11.150 --> 01:17.600
in the field of this I'm leaving up to you to explore on your own.

01:17.600 --> 01:22.830
Again the beauty with python is that you can go in so many directions throughout your career.

01:23.060 --> 01:27.170
But for now we still have lots more to learn so I'll see you in the next one.

01:27.170 --> 01:27.560
Bye bye.
