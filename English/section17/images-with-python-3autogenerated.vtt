00:00.520 --> 00:01.710
Welcome back.

00:01.780 --> 00:04.400
I have a new problem for you.

00:04.540 --> 00:07.530
I'm using a Web site here called on Splash dot com.

00:07.990 --> 00:12.760
It's an awesome Web site where you can actually download for free really good images.

00:12.760 --> 00:15.640
Maybe you want to have a new background for your Web site.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.130
Maybe a new background for your desktop.

00:18.130 --> 00:25.320
Anyway I found this space man image and I've downloaded it and I'll link to this image as well.

00:25.600 --> 00:32.580
Or you can pick whatever image you want from on Splash dot com and you'll see here that this image is

00:32.670 --> 00:34.430
three point eight megabytes.

00:34.440 --> 00:35.630
It's massive.

00:35.730 --> 00:44.430
And maybe I want to bring it down in size maybe do a 400 by 400 a thumbnail that I can use for my profile

00:44.430 --> 00:44.810
picture.

00:44.820 --> 00:46.680
So people know that I'm an astronaut.

00:47.580 --> 00:48.330
How can we do that.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.180
Well let's go back to our code.

00:51.240 --> 00:58.560
We have this Astro dot JPEG image and you can see over here I'm scrolling through it it's it's absolutely

00:58.560 --> 00:59.570
massive.

00:59.580 --> 01:00.080
OK.

01:00.330 --> 01:03.670
So let's make this smaller.

01:03.810 --> 01:13.460
I'm going to instead of pocket X say I want to grab the Astro dot JPEG image and we don't want to do

01:13.520 --> 01:20.630
any of this so I'm going to remove that and first of all let's just print what the image sizes just

01:20.630 --> 01:21.200
so we're clear.

01:21.230 --> 01:23.970
So I'm going to run this and we see that.

01:24.000 --> 01:34.470
Yep it's a pretty big image so all I'm going to do is say new image is going to be image dot resize

01:36.620 --> 01:40.640
and again a top all that says 400 by 400.

01:40.670 --> 01:43.210
And we've seen this before right.

01:43.240 --> 01:52.500
So now if I save this let's say new image dot Save and I'll call it thumb.

01:52.550 --> 02:01.360
Now dot fi save this and run this.

02:01.440 --> 02:02.220
All right.

02:02.220 --> 02:02.650
Look at that.

02:02.670 --> 02:08.570
We have a thumbnail dot JPEG that's actually great.

02:08.590 --> 02:11.500
Look at that it's tiny compared to the massive one we had.

02:11.500 --> 02:18.520
But one thing that I don't know if you can notice is that because the image did not have the same width

02:18.970 --> 02:20.450
and height.

02:20.500 --> 02:26.950
What happened was it is actually a little bit compressed so it lost his aspect ratio.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.040
The image looks kind of squished in.

02:29.740 --> 02:31.420
So how can we fix that.

02:31.450 --> 02:34.070
And this is a common problem with images right.

02:34.090 --> 02:41.750
If we make things smaller and smaller or we change the aspect ratio let's say 400 by 200.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.310
So if I save this and go to the image.

02:44.450 --> 02:48.110
Well yeah look at the images all squished up.

02:48.110 --> 02:55.130
How can we fix it well in this case so we can actually use a useful thumbnail method.

02:55.510 --> 03:03.490
So instead of saying resize if you want to keep the aspect ratio we can say thumbnail and this thumbnail

03:04.240 --> 03:13.640
will be 400 by two hundred so if I save and run this again we'll get an error non type object has no

03:13.640 --> 03:21.560
attribute safe and that is because thumbnail actually doesn't return a new image it just modifies the

03:21.560 --> 03:22.340
current one.

03:22.370 --> 03:31.050
So in here we can just say image dot thumbnail and then we'll say image dot safe.

03:31.060 --> 03:39.800
So if I run this and we go back to thumbnail look at that we have a thumbnail but it keeps the aspect

03:40.130 --> 03:47.150
ratio so even though I said four hundred by two hundred it's going to try and do its best to keep that

03:47.150 --> 03:50.390
aspect ratio and maybe not give the exact opposite that I want.

03:50.840 --> 03:54.140
So let's just bring it back to 400 by 400.

03:54.140 --> 03:55.060
Run it again.

03:55.130 --> 03:56.450
And there you go.

03:56.450 --> 04:00.830
We have our thumbnail and the astronaut is not squished.

04:00.830 --> 04:02.230
Very very useful.

04:02.240 --> 04:09.380
So the thumbnail one is really really useful maybe if you want to create a profile picture for Facebook

04:09.410 --> 04:13.780
or Instagram or any other social media platform that you might have.

04:14.030 --> 04:20.620
And it just gives a couple of width and height and this is the maximum value.

04:20.720 --> 04:27.860
So it's never going to go over 400 and 400 but thumbnail is going to automatically do anything within

04:27.920 --> 04:29.720
the range up to 400.

04:29.720 --> 04:40.620
But keeping the aspect ratio so if I actually do here print image dot size and I run this you'll see

04:40.620 --> 04:42.570
that that's exactly what happens.

04:42.600 --> 04:48.760
It's intelligently deciding what the best size for the image is.

04:48.930 --> 04:49.490
All right.

04:49.590 --> 04:54.410
Let's take a break and in the next video we're gonna do a fun little exercise.

04:54.540 --> 04:56.140
I'll see that one by.
