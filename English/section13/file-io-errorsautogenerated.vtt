Welcome back.

00:02.030 --> 00:07.610
One of the common patterns when working with files is to actually put them in a try except block.

00:08.090 --> 00:20.200
So in here we can say try and actually put them like this and try out to see if the file exists so we

00:20.200 --> 00:33.940
can say except and let's say file not found error which we've seen before and here I can say as air

00:34.750 --> 00:40.600
and inside we'll say print file does not exist.

00:41.570 --> 00:48.560
So that now if I run this and remember in our current directory we don't have sad dot text.

00:48.560 --> 00:53.990
If I run this I get an error file does not exist.

00:53.990 --> 00:56.470
We can even raise this error if we wanted to.

00:56.470 --> 00:59.470
So we can say raise error.

00:59.550 --> 01:01.530
So now it works as expected.

01:01.620 --> 01:07.010
I'll get filed does not exist and then give a file not found error.

01:07.020 --> 01:11.810
So this is a common way to work with files to handle different errors.

01:11.820 --> 01:24.960
Another common one with files is this idea of an I O error and an IO error usually happens when the

01:24.990 --> 01:32.040
computer or the machine you're on has some issue reading or writing or doing any sort of IO operation

01:33.270 --> 01:43.070
so you can have something like Hyo error in here and raise that error if you want again.

01:43.080 --> 01:54.500
If I run this file not found error if for some reason I give it a weird mode to do I get an unsupported

01:54.520 --> 01:55.410
operation error.

01:55.420 --> 02:03.490
The options are endless but I hope by now you have an idea of how to do file IO but let's do a fun exercise

02:03.490 --> 02:09.430
because up until now we haven't really done anything exciting we just read a bunch of text from a file

02:09.430 --> 02:13.330
and that was it nothing that creator.

02:13.330 --> 02:13.830
Right.

02:13.870 --> 02:20.650
So let's do something fun in the next video we're going to try and build a translator.

02:20.650 --> 02:21.070
That's right.

02:21.610 --> 02:23.080
I'll see in the next video.

02:23.160 --> 02:23.330
Bob.
