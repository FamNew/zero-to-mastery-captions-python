00:00.900 --> 00:07.260
Up until this point we've learned how to read files but we had this annoying thing with the cursor and

00:07.260 --> 00:10.120
then we had to close the file.

00:10.230 --> 00:12.590
So how can we fix this.

00:12.600 --> 00:19.620
Well a better way to actually do something like this and do file IO with python is with the built in

00:19.680 --> 00:20.840
with statement.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.990
Let me show you instead of what we had before.

00:24.090 --> 00:34.960
What we're gonna say is with open the name of the file and say as whatever the variable you want.

00:34.990 --> 00:42.910
So my file so now with open you can actually do something like this but you don't have to worry about

00:43.210 --> 00:47.960
closing so most of the time you want to use the With statement.

00:47.960 --> 00:52.070
This is the proper way to work with files in Python.

00:52.070 --> 01:01.410
And if I save here and run my script I get an error because I forgot the column here.

01:01.490 --> 01:02.790
If I run again.

01:02.810 --> 01:03.710
There you go.

01:03.710 --> 01:07.590
I get my output and I don't need to close my file.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.110
Everything is down for me.

01:09.260 --> 01:12.810
So this is a standard way to read a file.

01:12.860 --> 01:15.320
Now what if we wanted to write to a file.

01:15.320 --> 01:25.400
So far we've only read and actually underneath the hood open has a default parameter called mode equals

01:25.790 --> 01:37.300
to R which stands for read so with mode are we are able to read files when we don't specify the mode

01:37.870 --> 01:46.690
it automatically just assumes we're reading but if we wanted to write to a file we can simply do w for

01:46.900 --> 01:57.770
write so if I run this you see that I get an error now unsupported operation not readable because well

01:57.920 --> 02:05.880
the file can only be written so in order for me to read and write I can write R W right.

02:05.940 --> 02:09.260
Well let's see.

02:09.350 --> 02:11.860
No that's actually not how it works.

02:11.860 --> 02:17.770
You think it'll be RW but this is a bit of a trick in order to read and write.

02:17.790 --> 02:31.410
We do read plus so that if I run this all right I'm reading and writing and I get an empty list because

02:31.740 --> 02:33.990
this is now empty.

02:33.990 --> 02:34.180
Okay.

02:34.200 --> 02:41.210
So let's write to a file here let's make this a little bit smaller just so we can see that's better.

02:43.140 --> 02:52.650
Let's say that in this file I want to have text and in this text I'm going to say my file thought right

02:54.460 --> 02:57.550
and I can write whatever piece of text I want.

02:57.550 --> 03:06.180
So let's say Hey it's me.

03:06.330 --> 03:17.060
So now in here if I do print text and I run this I get you'll love it.

03:17.120 --> 03:17.720
Mm hmm.

03:17.740 --> 03:18.530
What is this you love.

03:21.190 --> 03:21.370
Well.

03:21.380 --> 03:23.820
This is a really important right now.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.170
Well we want to focus on is.

03:25.190 --> 03:26.780
Hey it's me.

03:26.780 --> 03:28.300
I've read into a file.

03:28.370 --> 03:33.770
Okay so let's say I wanted to open the file again and actually write again.

03:33.770 --> 03:43.620
Let's say this time around I'm going to write a smiley face if I run this and go back.

03:43.730 --> 03:44.530
All right.

03:44.840 --> 03:54.560
It looks like I wrote to the file but oh is this what we wanted when we write something to a file.

03:54.730 --> 03:56.440
The cursor resets.

03:56.440 --> 04:05.930
Remember when we open a file the cursor goes to 0 and we write to the file and if there's something

04:05.930 --> 04:08.540
already existing in there while we overwrite it.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.190
So we have to be careful.

04:10.250 --> 04:19.780
And by the way this text file just gave us that we wrote two characters the smiley face Okay so how

04:19.780 --> 04:20.560
can we fix this.

04:20.560 --> 04:25.530
How can we make sure that we don't break what we have previously which is hey it's me.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.940
And I just want to add a smiley face at the end.

04:28.960 --> 04:38.620
Well we can use the append mode the append mode is a and this appends to the end of the file if I run

04:38.620 --> 04:40.120
this look at that.

04:40.150 --> 04:43.820
Hey it's me with a smiley face it appends to the end.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.100
So that's the append mode.

04:46.330 --> 04:55.230
Again we can use w to write and if I run this it adds a smiley face.

04:55.250 --> 05:01.510
Now why did it not do like last time and overwrite the existing thing.

05:01.520 --> 05:12.450
Well it's because of our mode w allows us to write to a file previously when we did read and write.

05:12.590 --> 05:16.880
What happened was we read the file.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.710
Let's run this again.

05:18.710 --> 05:20.600
Actually let's go back to hey it's me.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.550
The way it was.

05:21.790 --> 05:23.030
And if I run this again

05:26.110 --> 05:36.980
because we did read and write the cursor was set to zero and overrode it versus if we just did the right

05:38.060 --> 05:45.720
it will assume this is a new file and we just want to well just add the smiley face if I click Run here

05:46.350 --> 05:48.550
you see that now is just smiley face.

05:48.600 --> 05:53.970
So you want to be careful that you use the right mode based on what you need.

05:54.000 --> 06:02.710
Now let's say we wanted to create a file that doesn't exist let's have a file called Happy dot text

06:04.070 --> 06:08.820
or actually no less to set and this writes a sad face.

06:08.820 --> 06:10.830
But remember we don't have this on our desktop.

06:10.830 --> 06:15.530
If I clear this and look at our desktop we don't have a sad dot text.

06:15.540 --> 06:27.550
If I do read plus here so read and write and I run this I get a file not found here if I do a right

06:27.760 --> 06:31.320
here and I run this all right.

06:31.340 --> 06:32.380
It looks like it worked.

06:32.390 --> 06:36.780
If I look at the files I have a sad text now.

06:36.800 --> 06:44.500
So now if I open it I have it sat face text so right.

06:44.520 --> 06:50.600
Also creates a new file if it doesn't exist already or over writes the existing one.

06:50.640 --> 06:55.050
So you want to be careful once again with the mode if whether you want to append whether you want to

06:55.050 --> 06:57.530
read whether you want to read and write.

06:57.840 --> 07:03.040
But most of the time the most common ones are read write and append.

07:03.180 --> 07:08.250
Now in the next video I want to talk about this idea of a file.

07:08.430 --> 07:14.100
I've ridden text files for now but we could have written anything we could have done a dot pie file

07:14.280 --> 07:15.370
if I wanted to.

07:15.450 --> 07:21.110
But what about accessing files that are in different locations such as inside of folders.

07:21.180 --> 07:23.040
We can explore that topic in the next video.
