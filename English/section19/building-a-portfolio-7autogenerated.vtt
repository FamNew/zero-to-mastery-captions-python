00:00.790 --> 00:01.950
Welcome back.

00:02.020 --> 00:05.630
It's time to learn about CSI fees or CSP files.

00:05.650 --> 00:10.380
Those are Excel files that we're going to try and create our database in.

00:10.870 --> 00:19.690
Now luckily for us Python has a CSC module and we're going to use the CSP module to do the things that

00:19.810 --> 00:27.970
we're going to do which is to write instead of our text file to a CSP file.

00:27.980 --> 00:36.440
Now if we keep scrolling down here you can read all about the CSC module and how to use it but instead

00:36.440 --> 00:42.320
of going through it line by line let's just code it and show you exactly how it works.

00:42.350 --> 00:51.830
So I'm going to create a new file and this time it's going to be called database dot CSC and let's go

00:51.830 --> 01:00.710
back to our server dot pi and instead of having the right to file function let's write another function

01:01.880 --> 01:04.940
which will be the right to CSC

01:07.770 --> 01:13.650
and this one will be a little bit different because we have to use the CSC module.

01:13.650 --> 01:18.560
So I'm going to actually import it if we go to the documentation.

01:18.560 --> 01:27.910
You can see that we can import it just like this import CSC that comes built in with Python now in here

01:29.170 --> 01:34.590
we're going to do something similar except we're going to open the file that is the CSP file.

01:34.750 --> 01:42.690
We're going to append to this file and we're just going to call it database or in our case database

01:42.790 --> 01:46.500
to all as you say database to here.

01:46.500 --> 02:00.290
Now we have our data that we receive but instead of a file now we have a CSP or a CSP writer.

02:01.140 --> 02:05.080
So we're gonna do a few different things here.

02:05.130 --> 02:17.120
First we're going to write in our CSC these columns now with a CSP file by using these commas so we

02:17.120 --> 02:18.260
have the e-mail column.

02:18.260 --> 02:25.370
The subject column in The Message column and the commas essentially say this is the end of this column.

02:25.460 --> 02:28.660
This is the end of this column and this is the third column.

02:29.060 --> 02:31.660
So we can keep it the way that we have in the database.

02:31.670 --> 02:35.830
Dot text file now in here.

02:35.830 --> 02:52.090
Let's remove what we have here and we're going to say the dot right or writer to write to our CSC file.

02:52.090 --> 02:56.640
And this writer takes different parameters that we can give it.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.220
One is where do we want to write this.

02:59.220 --> 03:05.170
Well we want to write to the database to that is the file that we just opened.

03:05.180 --> 03:10.020
The second is a couple of options that we have now.

03:10.160 --> 03:20.340
If we go to the documentation and we scroll all the way up you see that we have the writer CSP die writer

03:20.640 --> 03:23.300
and then a couple of options.

03:23.350 --> 03:33.210
Now this delimiter quote character and quoting are just options that we can give it that you can read

03:33.210 --> 03:37.360
on your own to tell it how we want to write into this.

03:37.350 --> 03:43.630
Yes FIFA in our case I want the delimiter to be the

03:46.580 --> 03:57.540
that is each item in a row will be separated by a comma and whether we want any quotes around the characters

03:59.650 --> 04:05.590
while I don't want any so this is this could just be an empty string.

04:05.820 --> 04:12.830
And then finally quoting is going to be CSC dot.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.030
Well we can just copy exactly what's over here.

04:15.030 --> 04:18.420
Let's just copy quoting CSB quote minimal

04:21.190 --> 04:23.600
and again just to practice this.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.720
Let's say you wanted to know what quote minimal means.

04:26.720 --> 04:32.600
Again we just look for that in the text and it looks like instructs to write our object to only quote

04:32.630 --> 04:40.740
those fields which contain special characters so essentially it's saying Don't wrap data in quotes unless

04:40.740 --> 04:42.480
we really really need to.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.420
Again something that you don't have to worry about.

04:44.430 --> 04:49.920
This is more of configuration that you can just copy and paste and you can read up on your own what

04:49.950 --> 04:52.070
each of these meet.

04:52.180 --> 04:59.640
The important part is the fact that we're writing to the database with some options.

04:59.790 --> 05:09.940
So now we have this CSP writer object that we can use so this CSP writer can now be used like this.

05:10.030 --> 05:21.000
We can write a row so right row in this right row will contain the data that we want and we have that

05:21.000 --> 05:21.320
right.

05:21.330 --> 05:34.610
We want to write row exactly like we have above like this except the way we write rows is that we give

05:34.610 --> 05:39.040
it just each parameter.

05:39.040 --> 05:47.680
So we want to give it the email variable which we have here the subject variable and then the message

05:48.250 --> 05:48.700
variable

05:52.470 --> 05:59.910
just like that because we already have email subject and message and the CSB writer is smart enough

05:59.910 --> 06:06.690
to say that these are going to be what we want and we just pass it in instead of parameters actually

06:06.720 --> 06:08.560
as a list.

06:08.790 --> 06:18.630
Like so so that this row is going to contain email subject and message that we extract from the data.

06:18.700 --> 06:21.590
Now if we didn't make any mistakes this should work.

06:21.610 --> 06:26.800
But let's check this instead of right to file this to write to CSC.

06:27.190 --> 06:36.870
I'll save go open up the terminal go back to our page and let's go to contact me again.

06:36.920 --> 06:50.340
Let's do w at w dot com some text some text and hit send oh we have a bit of an error here quote character

06:50.340 --> 06:52.690
must be set if quoting enable.

06:52.740 --> 07:02.000
So it looks like I have just a bit of an error here and that is because we actually need a quote character

07:02.240 --> 07:03.920
to not be empty in here.

07:03.920 --> 07:08.750
So if we're going to quote something we just need to say hey what are we going to use.

07:08.750 --> 07:14.750
And in our case we can use the quote sign with the double possibly.

07:15.020 --> 07:16.720
Again we can use whatever we want.

07:16.790 --> 07:20.890
You might use this if you want or this whatever you prefer.

07:21.140 --> 07:25.340
So let's just do a quote that we use in a string.

07:25.380 --> 07:26.690
I'm going to save this.

07:26.690 --> 07:31.830
Give it another go let's refresh actually.

07:31.830 --> 07:35.470
Let's go back and submit again.

07:35.480 --> 07:35.880
All right.

07:35.930 --> 07:36.470
Thank you.

07:36.470 --> 07:38.570
I'll get in touch with you shortly.

07:38.570 --> 07:41.160
And if we go back to our database.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.080
All right.

07:42.080 --> 07:51.060
We have our new data but you see over here that we don't have a new line let's actually open this CSP

07:51.100 --> 07:58.640
far if I go to database dot CSP and I double click here.

07:58.640 --> 07:59.180
All right.

07:59.270 --> 08:05.410
It looks like we're getting our data but our database e-mail and subject are a little bit off.

08:05.420 --> 08:05.920
Ideally.

08:05.920 --> 08:13.940
These are the labels and headers and all the rows come after it.

08:13.960 --> 08:17.920
Now let's go back and submit just a different user.

08:17.920 --> 08:22.280
Let's go a W at a couple of more hits sent.

08:22.300 --> 08:22.620
All right.

08:22.630 --> 08:30.070
We're adding new rows but the only issue is that the first time we add a new row we should have that

08:30.100 --> 08:31.990
extra spacing.

08:32.020 --> 08:33.870
Now this is an easy fix.

08:33.970 --> 08:43.120
If we go to CSB and scroll a little bit down we see that we have a right header method.

08:43.170 --> 08:55.060
So what we'll do instead is actually just add a new line option and just give it an empty string so

08:55.090 --> 08:56.900
let's just clear everything.

08:57.010 --> 08:59.350
Let's just clear everything in here.

08:59.350 --> 09:06.100
We're going to save the database and just have server dot pie.

09:06.100 --> 09:12.930
We're going to go back and submit the forms a couple of times just to make sure that everything works

09:14.250 --> 09:19.500
if I go back and go to my database dot CSP.

09:19.510 --> 09:19.720
All right.

09:19.750 --> 09:22.070
We have our data.

09:22.120 --> 09:27.490
If I open this now.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.620
There we go.

09:28.630 --> 09:37.240
We have our database right here with our headers and our entries so that now I can have as many entries

09:37.240 --> 09:45.480
as possible and people can contact me and I'll always have this database for me to check to see if anybody

09:45.480 --> 09:47.130
who wants to work with me.

09:47.200 --> 09:54.990
Very very cool but there's one other issue here that is right now.

09:55.010 --> 10:02.260
Were you just using an Excel file on the same machine as the server.

10:02.510 --> 10:10.960
You see there's a problem here because now my server and my database are in the same location.

10:11.090 --> 10:15.650
So yeah when the server stops my file is still saved.

10:15.650 --> 10:23.960
But what happens if maybe this computer breaks or something happens to it and I can turn it on anymore.

10:23.960 --> 10:29.180
I've lost my files or maybe we have so much data that we want to store.

10:29.180 --> 10:32.210
Well this is where actual databases come in.

10:32.210 --> 10:41.510
Databases specialize in storing information large scale applications can use databases to store large

10:41.510 --> 10:46.670
amounts of data and then do really interesting things with them kind of like an Excel sheet.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.730
But even more powerful.

10:49.160 --> 10:56.540
And on top of it we can actually have a database on a completely different machine maybe on multiple

10:56.540 --> 11:00.290
machines so that we're guaranteed not to lose that data.
