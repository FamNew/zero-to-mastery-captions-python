WEBVTT

00:02.080 --> 00:11.170
So we were able to submit our form and ideally now we have a way to capture that data that the user

00:11.170 --> 00:14.820
sent to the server once again.

00:14.860 --> 00:21.210
If I submit some sort of data and click sent I get form submitted her right now.

00:21.220 --> 00:28.040
If I open up the developer tools and refresh that you'll see that we have a few errors that we have

00:28.040 --> 00:29.670
to take care of.

00:29.690 --> 00:32.920
One is this form submitted.

00:33.080 --> 00:39.800
So if I scroll all the way down there's actually one thing I need to fix in order for my server to be

00:39.800 --> 00:42.600
able to read this data.

00:42.730 --> 00:49.360
We have to go into our contact dot HMO and we just have to make sure that all our inputs that is email

00:49.750 --> 00:55.600
text and the text area have a name attribute.

00:55.600 --> 01:00.940
And this is so we can actually grab the data on the back and I'll show you what I mean.

01:01.330 --> 01:15.740
So let's have name here as email name here as the subject and then name here

01:18.370 --> 01:21.580
as the message.

01:21.580 --> 01:33.990
So that if I save this now and I go back to my contacts and submit this again well we'll have to refresh

01:33.990 --> 01:34.420
you first.

01:34.420 --> 01:45.130
So let's refresh send some messages and if I click Submit now and we go to submit form

01:50.540 --> 01:56.390
you'll see that if I scroll all the way down I have a form data field.

01:56.480 --> 02:05.100
We now have email subject a message that we actually send all the way back to our flask application

02:06.390 --> 02:09.390
because we now gave it these name attributes.

02:09.390 --> 02:11.560
It knows what to send.

02:11.570 --> 02:20.720
So this is just a quick gotcha is just an Asian male form standard that we'll just have to add ourselves.

02:20.940 --> 02:29.950
Now if we go to the flask documentation we can access these values using the request dot form so if

02:29.950 --> 02:39.800
we go back and we go to server dock by we can do something like they say in the documentation.

02:39.980 --> 02:47.090
I can say if the request and this request is something that will have to import and which I already

02:47.090 --> 02:49.840
have done from flask.

02:50.090 --> 02:59.600
So if request method which is if we said that the method is going to be post which if we looked at the

02:59.600 --> 03:04.950
contact that HMO we have the method ask post.

03:05.020 --> 03:18.220
So if that's the case then I want you to grab that data by doing request DOD form and I can access different

03:18.220 --> 03:24.490
values like email or message like this.

03:24.490 --> 03:33.160
Now an easy way for us to grab this information is actually to do a method called to dict which is turning

03:33.220 --> 03:36.250
something the form data into a dictionary.

03:36.250 --> 03:42.280
So we're gonna get everything as a dictionary and then finally to make sure that we get this data.

03:42.310 --> 03:51.580
Let's just print data and we just got to return something so let's say return and I want you to return

03:52.710 --> 03:54.510
form submitted

03:57.590 --> 04:02.240
otherwise we'll just return.

04:02.370 --> 04:05.430
Something went wrong.

04:05.430 --> 04:08.840
Try again if we save this

04:11.740 --> 04:19.720
let's open up our terminal and let's go back to the form let's refresh.

04:19.750 --> 04:24.360
I'm going to close this for now and just submit our regular information.

04:24.490 --> 04:32.180
If I click sent form as submitted I have some errors here that we're gonna have to fix soon but if I

04:32.180 --> 04:43.900
scroll a little bit up look at that we have e-mail subject and message as a dictionary on our back end.

04:43.900 --> 04:46.710
We just transfer data to our Python app.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.730
How cool is that.

04:48.930 --> 04:58.500
Now the reason we get this error at the bottom is because right now when I submit a form I'm still requesting

04:58.500 --> 05:01.120
the five icon icon.

05:01.140 --> 05:10.980
Now if we go back to our application you'll notice that anytime we visit a new area our father Khan

05:10.980 --> 05:13.960
is not showing well.

05:14.040 --> 05:18.040
If we go back to our page let's go to index dot HMO.

05:18.270 --> 05:20.420
We'll see that in the link over here.

05:20.430 --> 05:25.290
We're looking for our feathered Khan dot icon in static assets.

05:25.500 --> 05:30.650
But if you remember we have our bolt dot icon right in the static folder here.

05:30.750 --> 05:39.690
So all we have to do is just either rename some of those files or in our case we can just move this

05:40.260 --> 05:51.400
call it Farrakhan that icon and move it into the static assets folder.

05:51.410 --> 05:57.350
Now if I refresh the page you'll see that I have my new bolt that icon.

05:57.420 --> 06:06.880
Finally I want to actually do something more interesting once a user submits a form.

06:07.120 --> 06:10.570
I want to have a little thank you message.

06:10.680 --> 06:16.440
Now there's many ways of doing this but the easiest way we're going to do is we're going to copy this

06:16.440 --> 06:17.150
entire file.

06:17.220 --> 06:20.660
So I'm just going to say duplicate and call it.

06:20.910 --> 06:31.170
Thank you Dot HMO now thank you dot HMO will be the exact same thing as the contact page that we created

06:33.410 --> 06:36.170
except instead of the form that we have.

06:36.170 --> 06:41.290
So let's grab this form information.

06:41.290 --> 06:58.290
So instead of having this for perhaps it will simply say thank you I will get in touch with you shortly.

06:58.300 --> 07:05.560
Now the cool thing that we can do here is that we can now redirect to the thank you page after they

07:05.560 --> 07:12.910
submit the contact form and that way we can do that is in the server up PI we can import let's make

07:12.910 --> 07:18.280
this a little bit smaller and it will import the redirect

07:23.100 --> 07:30.910
and all we have to do here instead of saying form submitted is we can say redirect to what route.

07:30.930 --> 07:33.210
Well it will redirect to.

07:33.510 --> 07:43.380
Thank you Dot H2 email like this again because thank you that HMO is in our templates and because our

07:43.380 --> 07:49.120
routes are setup to change dynamically we should be able to redirect to thank you.

07:49.270 --> 08:01.020
HMO fi save and let's save refresh submit some data on here quick send like that.

08:01.020 --> 08:04.440
Thank you I will get in touch with you shortly.

08:05.230 --> 08:06.570
How cool is that.

08:06.700 --> 08:09.890
And there's many cool things that we can do here right.

08:10.090 --> 08:10.930
Using the

08:13.990 --> 08:21.190
curly brackets like this if let's say we ask somebody to submit their user name or a name we can say

08:21.280 --> 08:22.330
thank you.

08:22.330 --> 08:25.720
With perhaps their actual name that be submitted.

08:25.810 --> 08:28.280
So something like Thank you Bob or thank you.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.590
But that's something we've already talked about for now.

08:32.590 --> 08:39.640
That looks pretty nice so I'm able to now submit a contact form

08:43.080 --> 08:45.630
make sure that you don't get any errors.

08:45.720 --> 08:55.080
So if I click on send look at that issue mail even tells me hey this has to be an email.

08:55.130 --> 08:59.420
Okay let's send in there we go.

08:59.420 --> 09:00.750
Everything is working.

09:00.800 --> 09:09.710
There are no errors we're submitting the form with all our data and we're receiving all that information

09:12.390 --> 09:15.390
right over here.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.890
How cool is that.

09:19.470 --> 09:28.620
So we now have our server dot pie setup to actually accept information and now we have our Web site

09:28.740 --> 09:34.620
that's able to well hopefully allow us to have clients message.

09:35.400 --> 09:42.830
But we need to do something with this data to store it somewhere because now this is in memory.

09:42.820 --> 09:46.650
Anytime I close the server this information is lost.

09:46.680 --> 09:55.230
Ideally we persisted somewhere or ideally we store it somewhere so that in the future we can go back

09:55.260 --> 09:59.680
maybe a week later and see who has submitted a form on our Web site.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.110
Let's do that in the next video.
