WEBVTT

00:00.920 --> 00:01.830
Welcome back.

00:01.850 --> 00:05.210
Let's build our first Web site now.

00:05.260 --> 00:12.940
I've already created a folder called Web server because this is going to be our web server for now.

00:12.940 --> 00:19.930
And inside of this web server we have an index Don ACM all file which will be the extension for creating

00:19.930 --> 00:20.960
a nation email file.

00:20.980 --> 00:28.180
We have script dot J.S. which is the extension for writing javascript just like we have dot PI for writing

00:28.180 --> 00:29.110
Python.

00:29.110 --> 00:33.540
And then we have style dot c assess for writing CSF styles.

00:33.580 --> 00:39.920
Now in this section I'm going to be using Sublime Text and my eye term terminal.

00:40.060 --> 00:43.330
But you can use whatever developer tool that you want.

00:43.600 --> 00:49.480
I like using these ones just for the screen recordings they help because well it's nice and clean it

00:49.480 --> 00:55.810
doesn't give me too many hints so that I can also make errors and show you along as I make errors how

00:55.810 --> 00:57.070
I fix them.

00:57.250 --> 01:01.480
But again you can use Visual Studio code whatever you prefer.

01:01.520 --> 01:09.990
Now you see over here that all these files are empty but remember a web server simply gives these three

01:09.990 --> 01:17.070
files to a browser so that the browser can display the page so let's start off with a Shia e-mail.

01:17.360 --> 01:22.790
How do we write HMO well Sublime Text actually lets me do something interesting here.

01:22.820 --> 01:29.690
If I type in a CML and then hit tab it auto fills it for me.

01:29.690 --> 01:30.340
All right all right.

01:30.350 --> 01:34.130
I kind of cheated but hey I don't want to bore you to death.

01:34.310 --> 01:43.280
So this is a standard HMO file because I have the DOT HMO extension if I have this type of syntax I

01:43.280 --> 01:46.820
can write HMO and it's not that difficult.

01:46.820 --> 01:51.380
We have opening tags and closing tags with the backslash here.

01:51.380 --> 01:55.130
So we have the head of the Web site with the title.

01:55.130 --> 01:57.710
So this is what appears on the tab.

01:57.800 --> 02:04.250
So let's say my Web site very creative.

02:04.350 --> 02:05.280
So that's the head.

02:05.280 --> 02:06.380
And then the body.

02:06.450 --> 02:09.960
This is what gets displayed on a Web site.

02:09.990 --> 02:18.220
So in here I can say I am a web master just like that.

02:18.360 --> 02:21.400
And we've created are a sham Alpha.

02:21.400 --> 02:30.150
Now check this out if I now open index on a HMO if I right click here and let's say open in your window

02:30.720 --> 02:34.230
or you can even just go and double click this file.

02:34.260 --> 02:36.270
So if I double click this.

02:36.270 --> 02:38.970
Look at that I am a web master.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.680
Just simple text.

02:40.680 --> 02:49.730
Nothing too crazy but I've just created my first web site let's continue with CSX CSX has a different

02:50.570 --> 02:55.950
syntax than a Shia CSF syntax goes something like this.

02:56.320 --> 03:03.730
We can give it what a simple element we want to add some styling to in our case let's say body and I

03:03.730 --> 03:13.330
can say body then curly brackets and in here I want to have background let's say color and we'll go

03:13.330 --> 03:25.390
with let's go with green Phi save this and I refreshed the page Mm hmm.

03:25.430 --> 03:27.170
Nothing happened.

03:27.170 --> 03:32.540
And this is a little small detail that again this isn't a web development course so we don't need to

03:32.570 --> 03:33.560
worry too much about.

03:33.770 --> 03:42.440
But essentially the very first thing that happens is that the HMO file gets sent and the HMO file is

03:42.440 --> 03:46.110
actually the only thing that gets read by the browser.

03:46.550 --> 03:53.870
So within the HMO file I have to say hey HMO by the way we also have a c assess file.

03:53.870 --> 03:58.320
Can you also use that in the website so we can do that in the head.

03:58.320 --> 04:07.700
Tag by using something called a link tag so a link tag can actually remove some of this.

04:07.830 --> 04:16.710
We simply have to say hey it's a type of text C Ss and it has something called H riff H or f simply

04:16.710 --> 04:24.750
says hate whereas this file located in our case because it's in the same folder as our index site HMO

04:25.290 --> 04:33.030
we can simply say it's style dot c SS because well just look for style that's SS and that's where the

04:33.390 --> 04:35.250
style file is.

04:35.250 --> 04:41.160
And now if you remember we also had the relationship style sheet that we need to include.

04:41.160 --> 04:44.810
I just removed it so that we can see why we're writing over here.

04:44.850 --> 04:50.520
So if we do style sheet and this is just something a syntax that you have to get used to if you want

04:50.520 --> 05:00.750
to include a CSX file if I saved this and go back and refresh it look at that my ugly Web site let's

05:00.750 --> 05:09.030
make it a little bit bigger my ugly Web site with a green background color now has some stop if I open

05:09.030 --> 05:10.400
up the developer tools.

05:10.440 --> 05:10.980
Once again

05:14.330 --> 05:23.740
and I hit refresh look at that I get an HMO file and a CSX file awesome.

05:24.130 --> 05:27.360
So I just created my own Web server.

05:27.580 --> 05:28.630
Right.

05:28.750 --> 05:34.240
We could even write JavaScript here but again this is in a javascript core so we don't need to worry

05:34.240 --> 05:34.780
about it.

05:34.810 --> 05:36.280
In this case here you go.

05:36.280 --> 05:43.840
I just wrote some javascript which this is kind of like writing print in Python five refresh the page

05:43.840 --> 05:52.750
one more time again JavaScript file doesn't get displayed because well we have to again tell index that

05:52.750 --> 06:01.900
a symbol that we need a javascript file and usually JavaScript files are contained in a script tag usually

06:01.900 --> 06:03.670
at the bottom of the body.

06:03.820 --> 06:05.030
So let's close that.

06:05.050 --> 06:13.210
And then in here instead of using the H ref we just have to say as RC for source and then once again

06:13.270 --> 06:14.660
where's the javascript file.

06:14.680 --> 06:17.100
It's at script J Yes.

06:17.500 --> 06:26.050
So if I save this and I refresh the page look at that we're now loading this script J.S. file and all

06:26.050 --> 06:29.920
it's doing is if we click on the console tab is there you go.

06:29.920 --> 06:36.730
It printed something in the console and console is something that JavaScript uses but all we care about

06:36.730 --> 06:47.460
is that we're able to serve these three files what we've done is created our very first server but you

06:47.460 --> 06:56.150
may have noticed something when you went up over here look at the you URL path that we have that's not

06:56.450 --> 06:59.760
why you usually type into a Web site right.

06:59.780 --> 07:04.340
I mean we saw that the Web site over here is Casey D dot com.

07:04.340 --> 07:11.060
Well has the dot com uses a GDP that's a real Euro right.

07:11.160 --> 07:19.040
Well I'm sorry to tell you that we didn't actually create a real web server because all we've done is

07:19.040 --> 07:26.840
we've served to the browser some files from as you can see from our computer.

07:26.900 --> 07:33.350
So all it's doing is the browser saying hey I'm going to display these files that are located right

07:33.350 --> 07:40.890
here on your computer so essentially we have a web server that's also running a browser but that's not

07:40.890 --> 07:42.640
how real life works.

07:42.660 --> 07:44.790
Why would that be.

07:44.790 --> 07:52.260
Well imagine if he had your own Web site do you really want to have people from all over the world access

07:52.320 --> 07:57.750
your Web site directly through your computer grabbing the files from your computer.

07:57.750 --> 07:59.310
I mean no right.

07:59.310 --> 08:03.540
There's a lot of security issues there's a lot of issues with performance.

08:03.540 --> 08:08.040
You have to keep your laptop on the entire time so people can access your Web site.

08:08.060 --> 08:15.180
Instead we want to a web server which as the name suggests service files and specializes in serving

08:15.180 --> 08:20.520
files to browsers somewhere in the world that I don't have to worry about.

08:20.520 --> 08:26.430
It's not on my computer somebody owns that machine somebody owns that computer and it's on all the time

08:26.460 --> 08:32.820
so that whenever we go to a Web site or a link it's always going to be running and sending those files

08:32.880 --> 08:34.000
out.

08:34.050 --> 08:41.190
So we're finally going to get back to Python here because what we want to do is do something more sophisticated

08:41.430 --> 08:48.930
than just having these files on our machine instead we want to build a real server using Python that

08:48.930 --> 08:55.130
we can deploy so that people can access our Web site anywhere in the world.

08:55.140 --> 09:00.600
Now you might still be confused this whole process might not make complete sense to you because we're

09:00.600 --> 09:02.130
just getting started but don't worry.

09:02.160 --> 09:05.470
By the end of it all it's all going to make sense.

09:05.520 --> 09:13.710
So let's forget about the browser for now and get into building a real server something more sophisticated

09:13.740 --> 09:19.170
than what we've done up until now which is just a folder with these three files and we just double click

09:19.170 --> 09:20.430
on index that Asia.

09:21.390 --> 09:23.500
I'll see you in the next video by.
