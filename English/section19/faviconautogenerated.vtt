00:00.750 --> 00:01.770
Welcome back.

00:01.770 --> 00:04.080
Were you able to figure it out.

00:04.140 --> 00:11.000
I just googled around for some free dot ICL icons and I really really like this lightning bolt one.

00:11.010 --> 00:21.680
So I've just downloaded it as an ICAO and now it's in my folder over here as Bolt dot ICAO.

00:22.100 --> 00:28.880
Now how were you able to solve this if your first instinct was to google for it.

00:28.880 --> 00:29.900
Well good job.

00:29.930 --> 00:32.210
That's what you want to do as a developer.

00:32.570 --> 00:37.100
You see over here that well flask has documentation on how we can use it.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.060
Now there's two ways to do it.

00:41.130 --> 00:47.090
We have this link way and a way that works with older browsers as well.

00:48.470 --> 00:57.440
Now this syntax might not be obvious to you but let's use this method and then I'm going to show you

00:57.560 --> 01:00.450
what it actually does.

01:00.530 --> 01:03.170
So let's just copy paste.

01:03.170 --> 01:10.140
So we go into our index today Schimmel and in our link tag I'm going to add this.

01:10.400 --> 01:17.660
So let's make this a little bit bigger so we can see and maybe a little smaller so that everything is

01:17.660 --> 01:23.950
in here and we see here that we have this syntax that we haven't seen before.

01:24.070 --> 01:30.040
That's actually going to be used with flask that we're going to talk about but we see here that it's

01:30.040 --> 01:36.400
going to be for the static folder and the file name is going to be Saba Khan dot ICAO but minus called

01:36.400 --> 01:38.400
the bolt dot ICAO.

01:38.410 --> 01:42.150
So let's just call it bolt dot ICL.

01:42.430 --> 01:43.740
That's the following.

01:43.840 --> 01:45.910
And it should be in the aesthetic folder.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.500
So I'm going to move this

01:52.140 --> 02:00.120
into this static folder just like that now if I just.

02:00.240 --> 02:11.600
Here I can actually comment this out hit save and see what happens if I go back to my Web site and I

02:11.600 --> 02:15.020
refresh Hey look at that.

02:15.250 --> 02:17.210
Do you see how I have a little bolt here.

02:17.230 --> 02:21.150
You see that the bolt dot ICL is now on my Web site.

02:21.160 --> 02:22.540
How cool is that.

02:22.630 --> 02:24.960
And I didn't really do anything crazy.

02:25.030 --> 02:29.460
I didn't even have to have an endpoint which is really really cool.

02:29.770 --> 02:36.100
Again flask because a father icon is something so common just makes it super easy for us so we don't

02:36.100 --> 02:45.390
have to clutter our code with a father con end point so I can just remove this but you know what.

02:45.390 --> 02:49.310
I'm not a big fan of doing things without understanding them.

02:49.380 --> 02:54.870
And right now what we just did here seems really really strange.

02:54.870 --> 03:01.770
Whereas this you are all for thing coming from what's with this double squiggly lines in the next video

03:01.800 --> 03:03.990
we're going to find out what all of this means.
