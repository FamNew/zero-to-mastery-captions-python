00:00.690 --> 00:01.700
Hey you're still there.

00:01.710 --> 00:05.370
I know this is a bit of a long project but stick with me.

00:05.370 --> 00:08.320
We're getting really really close.

00:08.370 --> 00:13.050
You see up until now we've built this whole system right.

00:13.080 --> 00:20.040
We have our HCM LCROSS and JavaScript files that we got free templates for and we also implemented our

00:20.040 --> 00:29.280
server so that the browser can actually send data to us and we can actually save that data and even

00:29.340 --> 00:36.930
send a thank you Asia email page back once somebody submits a form our web page is now something more

00:36.930 --> 00:40.330
dynamic than just text that people can read.

00:40.380 --> 00:48.300
People can now interact with our Web page by submitting a form and we now have sent this form data to

00:48.300 --> 00:55.220
our Python server but there was a problem that I mentioned in the last video that is as soon as the

00:55.220 --> 01:02.240
server stops running or maybe it crashes that data is lost because right now that information of the

01:02.240 --> 01:03.770
form is in memory.

01:04.430 --> 01:11.930
Ideally we write it somewhere on disk so that even if we stop the server that information is still somewhere

01:11.960 --> 01:20.860
on a file so that this file lives on this computer just like a file lives on your desktop or laptop.

01:20.960 --> 01:25.610
So how can we do this well we've done this before right.

01:25.610 --> 01:28.930
We simply write to a file.

01:29.040 --> 01:33.370
Now we're going to explore this topic a little bit more throughout the next couple of videos.

01:33.450 --> 01:42.780
But what I want to do is to close off some of these folders and create a new file in here that will

01:42.780 --> 01:48.100
be a text file and this file will just be called database dot DST.

01:48.150 --> 01:56.850
Just a simple text file and this database will act as our database where we store information that the

01:56.850 --> 01:58.710
server receives.

01:58.710 --> 02:04.260
So if you remember we're going to store email we're going to store a subject and then we're going to

02:04.260 --> 02:15.940
store the message so ideally we're able to append or add to this file as people submit the form.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.550
So how can we do this.

02:17.830 --> 02:21.400
If you want to pause the video and give it a try yourself.

02:22.360 --> 02:28.290
Otherwise let's try this we can create a new function here.

02:28.690 --> 02:29.500
Right.

02:29.830 --> 02:41.320
To file this right to file will receive some sort of data that will send and we're going to say with

02:42.880 --> 02:50.420
open again something that we've seen before and we're going to open the database.

02:50.580 --> 02:58.570
And again because it's in the same folder as the server we don't need to specify a file path we can

02:58.570 --> 03:07.380
say database dot text and we're going to open in the mode of a.

03:07.440 --> 03:13.740
So that is to append to that file because it already exists and we'll just call it as database

03:16.570 --> 03:29.760
and in here we'll say that the file will equal database dot right and then write what we want in our

03:29.760 --> 03:34.350
case we want to write the email

03:37.370 --> 03:47.860
the message or the subject and then the message and we can just extract that from our data.

03:47.970 --> 03:48.390
Right.

03:48.430 --> 03:56.180
That we're going to pass in so we can say that e-mail is going to equal the data email

04:01.030 --> 04:11.560
subject is going to equal data subject and their message is going to equal data message because it's

04:11.560 --> 04:12.440
a dictionary.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.300
Right.

04:13.330 --> 04:21.100
And then all we can do here is just do an F string and say that we want we want first of all a new line

04:21.370 --> 04:30.940
so that there's a new line every time there's an entry and we'll say that we want the email comma the

04:31.810 --> 04:40.930
subject and then finally comma the message so that's our right to file.

04:41.030 --> 04:52.430
Function and then in here instead of printing data we can just simply call right to file and pass in

04:53.000 --> 05:02.920
the data so let's save this and see what happens going to come back to the page and then click sent.

05:02.920 --> 05:03.250
All right.

05:03.250 --> 05:04.550
Looks like things have worked.

05:04.600 --> 05:11.660
But let's see if we actually wrote to file if I go to database look at that.

05:12.110 --> 05:14.700
I have my data.

05:14.780 --> 05:17.960
That is the e-mail the subject and the message.

05:17.960 --> 05:24.380
And if I go back to the page let's say go to contact again and this time let's do a different e-mail

05:26.510 --> 05:33.830
some tax some more text hit send and let's go back and how cool is that.

05:34.010 --> 05:40.520
We now have our own custom database where we store all these users information.

05:40.850 --> 05:47.190
And the cool part is that even if I close the server I still have this information with me.

05:47.320 --> 05:52.140
I can always come back and see who has submitted a form.

05:52.270 --> 05:59.130
Very very cool and if by now you realize this is how databases work.

05:59.190 --> 06:00.350
Well good for you.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.990
This is how databases work.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.210
This is why you hear the words database.

06:06.210 --> 06:14.520
A database is essentially a place for you to store data in a safe way outside of the server.

06:14.520 --> 06:14.900
Right.

06:14.910 --> 06:23.160
Because if your information is in memory as soon as the computer closes while that memory is gone instead

06:23.640 --> 06:30.630
a text file like this even if I shut down my computer and and turn it back on is always going to be

06:30.630 --> 06:34.500
on disk and it's what we call persisting.

06:34.500 --> 06:38.970
That is it persists so that it never gets deleted.

06:38.970 --> 06:41.790
But how can we make this better.

06:41.790 --> 06:44.500
Well right now this is just a text file.

06:44.520 --> 06:51.920
This is kind of inconvenient and hard to read maybe we're creating a startup landing page and we're

06:51.920 --> 06:59.570
collecting users information maybe e-mail so we can e-mail people when these startup launches a better

06:59.570 --> 07:04.740
way to create a database is maybe using a CSP file or an excel file.

07:04.820 --> 07:06.950
So in the next video let's explore that.
