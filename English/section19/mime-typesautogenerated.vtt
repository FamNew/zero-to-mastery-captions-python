Hey welcome back.

00:01.970 --> 00:09.450
I want to take a quick second to talk about this idea of data transfer from servers to the browsers.

00:09.740 --> 00:17.810
Now we saw that when we opened the developer tools we can go to the Network tab and actually see what

00:17.900 --> 00:21.470
type of data gets sent from the server.

00:21.470 --> 00:28.940
And here we saw that there's different types but we mainly talked about the HDMI all CSX and javascript

00:29.750 --> 00:33.590
but we also see that there is a few other types in here.

00:33.590 --> 00:45.120
If I click on let's say the HMO there's this field called content type that says it's a text ACM Alpha.

00:45.150 --> 00:53.010
Now this is something quite important because it uses something called a MIME type and it stands for

00:53.010 --> 00:56.490
multi-purpose Internet mail extensions.

00:56.520 --> 01:03.300
Sounds very impressive doesn't it and you see here and I'll link to this resource and let's make this

01:03.300 --> 01:10.980
a little bit bigger that browsers use this mind type not the file extension to determine how to process

01:11.010 --> 01:12.060
a you are well.

01:12.240 --> 01:20.280
So they look at the content type that our flask app actually automatically sends to the browser to determine

01:20.280 --> 01:25.220
what to do with that file so that they know hey is it an Asian file.

01:25.260 --> 01:26.630
Is it a CSF file.

01:26.640 --> 01:30.590
Is it a javascript file now at the end of the day.

01:30.630 --> 01:38.280
All this data that we're transferring it's all just text but they can be in different forms and the

01:38.280 --> 01:42.470
browsers can interact with them in different ways.

01:42.490 --> 01:50.010
For example if we scroll all the way down here we have different types but we want to focus on the important

01:50.070 --> 01:52.990
mind types for web developers.

01:53.190 --> 01:55.230
We have things such as plain text.

01:55.230 --> 01:58.810
We have CSX we have HMO.

01:59.030 --> 02:10.630
We have Javascript so that if I go to the javascript file here and I go to content type I see that.

02:10.640 --> 02:17.990
Yep it's application javascript and we see here that there's a little note about why it's application

02:18.140 --> 02:22.090
javascript here instead of text javascript.

02:22.170 --> 02:29.630
Either way this way the browser knows I'm about to read a javascript file do some certain things because

02:29.630 --> 02:32.000
it is a javascript file.

02:32.030 --> 02:35.550
Now if we keep scrolling down there's also image types.

02:35.600 --> 02:43.460
So again if we look at the images let's say the PMG again if we scroll down we see that it's an image

02:43.490 --> 02:45.820
PMG at the end of the day.

02:45.890 --> 02:51.900
It's actually text that we receive from the server but in a way that it can be read as APM EGFR.

02:52.520 --> 02:58.520
So based on this knowledge Web sites work by sending all this data and letting the browser take care

02:58.520 --> 03:07.400
of while building the page for us now so far we've only talked about HMRC SS and JavaScript and usually

03:07.400 --> 03:14.720
that's how Web sites are displayed but there's different ways that we can also use servers such as what

03:14.720 --> 03:16.640
we call API endpoints.

03:17.450 --> 03:25.080
So right here I have the swampy dot CEO which stands for the Star Wars API and what it does.

03:25.100 --> 03:28.210
As you can see here is it sends us data.

03:28.210 --> 03:33.050
So instead of displaying a Web page it just sends us information.

03:33.080 --> 03:43.210
So for example if I copy this like so and then let's say we do people over here so let's do people.

03:43.470 --> 03:44.350
If I hit enter

03:47.490 --> 03:57.790
Look at that I get this data and this content type is will be called Jason and Jason is just this format

03:58.240 --> 04:01.580
of data that we can use in our applications.

04:01.600 --> 04:09.400
So again a Web site might take this data and perhaps display the name Luke Skywalker on the front page

04:10.530 --> 04:19.470
so this end point instead of sending a schmaltzy SS in JavaScript just sends us this Jason data because

04:19.530 --> 04:24.670
at the end of the day all a server does is sent some data right.

04:24.690 --> 04:29.590
It serves data we can send all sorts of things.

04:29.660 --> 04:38.120
For example this robo hash Web site if I do let's say anything I want in here and I hit enter it sends

04:38.120 --> 04:40.490
me a random image of a robot.

04:40.520 --> 04:49.190
If I change anything in the Sandpoint I get a different robot so web developers and mobile developers

04:49.490 --> 04:57.740
use this idea of servers all around the world to try and grab information grab data from a server and

04:57.740 --> 05:02.630
display something useful on a browser.

05:02.630 --> 05:05.870
And I hope this shows you the power the servers have.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.980
We can do anything.

05:08.000 --> 05:16.860
The options are limitless and we can build all sorts of servers with Python to do all sorts of things

05:16.860 --> 05:18.120
for us.

05:18.210 --> 05:20.730
All right let's get back to our portfolio Web site.
