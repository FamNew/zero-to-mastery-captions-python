WEBVTT

00:00.690 --> 00:01.320
Oh boy.

00:01.350 --> 00:04.670
We have an extra exciting section for you.

00:04.710 --> 00:07.830
This is a section that I absolutely love.

00:07.860 --> 00:13.050
I got into programming because of web development and in this section we're going to explore how we

00:13.050 --> 00:20.040
can use python in web development and actually the way we use python in web development.

00:20.040 --> 00:22.580
We'll also work with mobile development.

00:23.310 --> 00:30.120
And this is a really exciting field because well as you're aware there's lots of Web applications there's

00:30.120 --> 00:33.750
lots of mobile applications and using Python.

00:33.750 --> 00:39.060
We can actually help build these applications in this section.

00:39.060 --> 00:46.110
I'm going to give you a general overview of web development what that involves how Web sites actually

00:46.110 --> 00:48.660
work how browsers work.

00:48.750 --> 00:56.460
We're also going to use Python to build our own server our own portfolio web page where people can view

00:56.460 --> 01:03.270
our portfolios and actually submit maybe a request to work with you or send you a message and actually

01:03.270 --> 01:06.640
store it in places like a database.

01:06.690 --> 01:14.370
So by the end of this section you're going to have your own portfolio Web site that is live and in production.

01:14.370 --> 01:22.140
It's gonna be a very very fun one but in order for us to learn how we can use python we need to first

01:22.470 --> 01:25.860
understand how the web works.

01:25.920 --> 01:30.110
So in the next video let's learn how the web works.

01:30.210 --> 01:30.990
I'll see in that one.

01:31.340 --> 01:31.890
Bye bye.
