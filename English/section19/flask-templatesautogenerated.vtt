WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:01.450
Welcome back.

00:01.500 --> 00:08.400
So we have our well frankly really boring Web site but we've created our server.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.770
But what else can we do.

00:10.800 --> 00:15.250
A server usually accepts a request from the browser.

00:15.290 --> 00:23.930
Right now up until now we've done what we call a route route that is the home road because in here we

00:23.930 --> 00:25.370
haven't written anything.

00:25.370 --> 00:32.730
But sometimes in a Web site you might see something like blog write and if I hit enter you see that

00:32.740 --> 00:38.560
not fun that you are all was not found on the server again.

00:38.600 --> 00:46.110
That's because right now our server is only waiting to hear for the route request.

00:46.110 --> 00:48.590
But if we type something like blog.

00:48.810 --> 00:51.470
Well there's no function here that cares about that.

00:51.470 --> 00:55.200
So it seems that there's nothing to care about and moves on.

00:55.680 --> 00:59.440
So let's create a blog wrote as well.

00:59.670 --> 01:04.690
I'm going to copy paste and just stay that hey we want to listen to the blog end point.

01:04.830 --> 01:15.910
This is going to be called let's call it blog and say these are my thoughts on blogs fi save again.

01:15.920 --> 01:19.950
We have the debugger mode so I don't need to restart fi refresh now.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.140
Look at that.

01:21.140 --> 01:25.670
These are my thoughts on blogs and if I go to their root directory I get.

01:25.760 --> 01:26.640
Hello.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.300
We now have multiple routes.

01:29.300 --> 01:30.450
How cool is that.

01:30.830 --> 01:38.170
By the way if we open up the developer tools go to developer tools open up the network and just refresh

01:38.170 --> 01:43.670
year you see that we're getting a document ignored this part.

01:43.760 --> 01:47.340
This is just the developer tools in the plugins that I have.

01:47.540 --> 01:50.270
But this is what we get back.

01:50.270 --> 01:54.010
We just get a simple document a response which is a text.

01:54.230 --> 02:02.790
And if I go to headers and I actually scroll down you see that I requested this your URL.

02:03.010 --> 02:12.490
I got a status of two hundred and I see here that the content type that the server responded with was

02:12.490 --> 02:15.870
something called text HMO.

02:15.870 --> 02:22.310
Now this is something that flask does for us you see over here that I just sent a string.

02:22.980 --> 02:29.010
But the flask automatically converts that to H2 and also that the browser can understand it as a matter

02:29.010 --> 02:40.640
of fact if I go to elements here you see here that I have my HMO with a body of hello inside of so that's

02:40.640 --> 02:47.980
something that we get automatically which is really really nice but now we can start doing some really

02:47.980 --> 02:49.450
neat things.

02:49.570 --> 03:00.300
For example let's create a another wrote and this time let's say I want the blog from let's say 2020

03:00.840 --> 03:04.780
about dogs can I do that.

03:04.800 --> 03:05.890
Well yeah absolutely.

03:05.910 --> 03:12.900
Let's say blog to and this says this is my dog.

03:12.950 --> 03:16.150
Very very engaging blog posts there.

03:16.160 --> 03:21.380
So now if I go back I do blog.

03:21.380 --> 03:26.780
All right I get that if I do blog 2020 let's say dogs I get.

03:26.780 --> 03:33.430
This is my dog awesome so I can have multiple routes like this.

03:33.530 --> 03:38.120
What if I remove this and have two blocks with the same end point

03:40.890 --> 03:51.480
if we go back and just go to blog I get these are my thoughts on blogs because once a hits a wrote that

03:51.510 --> 03:58.740
it sees which online nine it sees it's going to automatically just return and forget about the rest.

03:59.280 --> 04:08.710
So let's bring our dogs blog post back but you know what's a shame because we have this beautiful website.

04:08.710 --> 04:10.060
I'm being sarcastic here.

04:10.090 --> 04:15.690
This beautiful Asian male Web site that we've created with CSX and JavaScript.

04:15.700 --> 04:22.720
Wouldn't it be nice if instead of me just sending out text I can actually send those could I do that.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.730
Well yeah you can.

04:24.830 --> 04:34.790
You see flask has a another thing called render underscore template and this render template function

04:34.940 --> 04:38.600
is going to allow us to actually send the ACM alpha.

04:39.110 --> 04:40.690
So let's say the home wrote.

04:40.730 --> 04:46.910
Now instead of hello is going to do something different instead it's going to run the render template

04:46.970 --> 04:55.220
function that comes with flask and then here we give it the HMO file that we have so we can give it

04:55.250 --> 05:03.070
a route in our case because it's in the same folder as the server file.

05:03.070 --> 05:08.520
We can just do index dot hasty amount fight run this.

05:08.630 --> 05:09.900
Let's see if this works.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.520
If I go back to my home wrote I get an error.

05:14.630 --> 05:22.460
Let's read the error template not font index dot ECMO.

05:22.780 --> 05:28.110
So it's tried to look for index not a shemale and it didn't find it.

05:28.140 --> 05:29.780
That's not good is it.

05:29.940 --> 05:44.040
What if we do a dot slash which means current directory grab the index dot H2 HDL fi save and refresh.

05:44.120 --> 05:47.300
I still get the error.

05:47.480 --> 05:52.270
Again this is another thing that you'd have to just learn as you read the documentation.

05:52.370 --> 05:59.450
But the reason that this is not working is because flask automatically when you say render template

05:59.750 --> 06:03.350
tries to look in a folder called templates.

06:03.350 --> 06:04.540
So let's create that.

06:04.550 --> 06:08.030
I'm going to say new folder.

06:08.100 --> 06:19.080
Call it templates and put all my HMO files in this case the single HMO file that I have when I say move

06:20.010 --> 06:24.730
and put it in the templates folder.

06:24.760 --> 06:33.400
So now it's in here and let's save go back and refresh and look at that.

06:33.450 --> 06:35.440
I am a web master.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.480
Everything is working.

06:37.560 --> 06:48.040
If I go to blog I get these are my thoughts on blogs but my HMO file that I've created is working perfectly

06:49.100 --> 06:58.150
how awesome is that and flask use this this idea of templates to add multiple ACM alphas.

06:58.260 --> 07:00.980
So for example I can create a new file.

07:01.110 --> 07:03.180
Let's just say duplicate here.

07:03.180 --> 07:09.670
So I'm going to duplicate this file and call it a about Dot HMO.

07:09.790 --> 07:19.920
And this about that HMO is going to say about me and let's go into server dot pi and have the root folder

07:20.400 --> 07:27.980
index start HRT mouth and perhaps add another out say about Dot HMO.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.910
And yes I can do that as well.

07:30.020 --> 07:38.220
And in here we'll grab the about Dot HMO let's call it whatever we want let's say about function and

07:38.230 --> 07:41.520
if I go back go to

07:45.570 --> 07:49.910
well it's not going to work because remember I added the DOT HMO.

07:49.980 --> 07:50.670
There you go.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.180
About me awesome.

07:53.210 --> 07:53.810
This is great.

07:53.810 --> 08:00.620
We're starting to learn about different routes and how servers work and we're able to send our ACM off.

08:00.650 --> 08:04.350
But what about the JavaScript files and the CSF files.

08:04.370 --> 08:07.160
How can we do that in the next video we'll find out.
