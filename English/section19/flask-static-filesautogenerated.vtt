00:00.600 --> 00:01.740
Welcome back.

00:01.780 --> 00:11.610
Let's figure out how to add CSX and javascript to while our index dot HMO because if you remember we

00:11.610 --> 00:23.020
are using script and CSX and here now once again with flask if we go to let's say CSX we see that there's

00:23.110 --> 00:31.060
static files static files simply means it's a file that's never going to change.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.300
That is CSX in JavaScript.

00:33.310 --> 00:39.970
Usually once we send them out they're not going to change their static and you see over here that with

00:40.240 --> 00:46.650
flask we have to store the files on the false system as static slash style dots.

00:46.650 --> 00:47.140
Yes yes.

00:47.140 --> 00:50.850
So we need to create a static folder.

00:50.910 --> 00:55.620
Again this is something that you just have to get used to but let's say in here we'll create just like

00:55.620 --> 01:04.500
we did with templates we're going to create a static folder so that the floss gap knows to look in here

01:04.500 --> 01:06.270
for CSX and JavaScript files.

01:06.270 --> 01:18.580
So I'm going to move the javascript file to the static folder and do the same with the CSX file so once

01:18.580 --> 01:25.850
again move that to static.

01:25.860 --> 01:30.040
Now if I just say this and run you'll see that it won't actually work

01:33.610 --> 01:34.000
well.

01:34.090 --> 01:35.690
Why is that.

01:35.840 --> 01:43.340
Can you figure it out again because we haven't talked too much about Asia Mellon CSX and JavaScript.

01:43.380 --> 01:44.940
Don't worry if you don't get this.

01:44.940 --> 01:50.780
But if you remember in our index that HMO file we reference to these files inside of here.

01:50.970 --> 01:54.250
But the file parts have now changed.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.840
They're now in the static folder

02:00.960 --> 02:01.690
like this.

02:01.710 --> 02:08.810
So I have to say static script does J.S. fine now go back

02:12.370 --> 02:14.630
and refresh.

02:14.780 --> 02:16.000
Hey look at that.

02:16.150 --> 02:22.390
My beautiful green Web site for let's say this is Christmas Web site is now working.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.220
If I open up the developer tools

02:27.600 --> 02:30.170
go to network and refresh.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.590
Hey check that out.

02:31.590 --> 02:33.830
I have my document.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.920
Then I have my J.S. file.

02:36.200 --> 02:39.450
And why is there no CSX.

02:39.450 --> 02:40.800
Let me refresh again.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.600
Oh there it is right over there.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.800
We have style CSX.

02:44.850 --> 02:49.570
We have J.S. and we have the document awesome.

02:49.710 --> 02:55.440
If you're wondering why we're getting this little fatty Con Air that the con is the little icon that

02:55.440 --> 03:01.920
shows up on tabs over here so we can actually even add our own father icon if we wanted to and send

03:02.070 --> 03:09.330
images in the way we would do that is to again in our End Point blitz instead of the blog.

03:09.420 --> 03:17.920
I'm going to say the con that dot ICL for icon and we can just send it an image.

03:17.920 --> 03:18.800
Mm hmm.

03:18.810 --> 03:21.470
How will we go about doing this.

03:21.510 --> 03:26.160
I'm going to show you the answer in the next video but I want you to give it a try and figure out how

03:26.160 --> 03:31.240
you can send an image back to this end point so that we don't get this error.

03:31.260 --> 03:36.930
And when a browser automatically requests for this which all browsers do it's going to show up a little

03:36.930 --> 03:38.280
icon over here for us.

03:38.280 --> 03:43.140
So pick whatever icon you want and see if I can solve it in the next video I'll show you the answer.
