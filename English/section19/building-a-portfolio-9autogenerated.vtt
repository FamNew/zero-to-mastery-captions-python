WEBVTT

00:00.930 --> 00:08.160
Now the last step in order for us to deploy our portfolio Web site is to go to the configuration file

00:08.280 --> 00:11.340
right here when we click on this.

00:11.340 --> 00:18.990
You'll get a whole bunch of text and we can actually delete a ton of these things you'll see over here

00:18.990 --> 00:24.610
that you can have things set up based on what framework you use like flask.

00:24.630 --> 00:35.220
So because we're using flask let's remove all of this code just have the flask section and we'll remove

00:35.250 --> 00:36.250
the comments.

00:36.390 --> 00:44.340
So we have import CIS and it has some description here that you can read on your own.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.780
But the key thing that we want

00:51.040 --> 00:55.710
is to remove the comments from here.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.440
Just like that.

00:57.680 --> 01:00.760
And then we want to make sure that the directory.

01:00.890 --> 01:04.010
So Andre has a path

01:07.180 --> 01:11.410
portfolio so remember our directory was home user name.

01:11.410 --> 01:22.000
And then the name of our project next we want to make sure that we give the name as the name of our

01:22.000 --> 01:22.560
file.

01:22.570 --> 01:25.370
So in my case it was server dot pi.

01:25.620 --> 01:33.860
If you remember I have server dot pie right over here and we're exporting it as app.

01:33.970 --> 01:38.690
So the app is the variable and server is the file name.

01:38.710 --> 01:43.220
So if you have a different file name let's say you have run dot pie.

01:43.240 --> 01:45.380
Then you'd put run here.

01:46.030 --> 01:53.830
So let's do server let's see it save and let's go back to the Web.

01:54.370 --> 02:00.190
If I reload and run this we get an error.

02:00.190 --> 02:06.040
Now an interesting feature of Python anywhere is that we can actually look at the logs.

02:06.150 --> 02:10.580
So over here the log files we can see what errors or what the server is logging.

02:10.630 --> 02:14.660
So in our case let's look at the errors module not found error.

02:15.070 --> 02:19.160
No module named server all right.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.570
That's interesting.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.570
Let's see why that might be.

02:22.640 --> 02:30.460
So if we go back to our configuration file the reason that we got the error was well because I misspelled

02:30.520 --> 02:33.490
the path so it cannot find the server.

02:33.490 --> 02:47.590
So Port FO If I see this go back to web reload and click on our Web site Ho Lee moley.

02:47.740 --> 02:56.320
We have our portfolio project life that link over there I can share with anybody and they could see

02:56.320 --> 02:59.440
it on their computer if they're halfway across the world.

02:59.710 --> 03:00.870
Let's say in India.

03:00.870 --> 03:01.180
Yep.

03:01.240 --> 03:03.580
They can see my portfolio.

03:03.580 --> 03:06.340
But you want to know what the coolest part is.

03:06.340 --> 03:12.520
Well the fact that all of our pages work but also our contact form.

03:12.610 --> 03:20.350
So if I do something like let's make this a little bit bigger so you can see are two dot.com some subject

03:20.350 --> 03:32.960
line and then oh somebody super super excited I hit send that worked in the cool part is that next time

03:33.380 --> 03:35.990
let's say somebody contacted you.

03:35.990 --> 03:42.210
All you have to do is actually go back to Python anywhere.

03:42.220 --> 03:44.500
So let's go to a new page of Python anywhere

03:48.600 --> 03:57.620
go into the files and then check out the database dot CSP and look at that.

03:57.620 --> 04:05.780
You have a new entry into your CSP file and I can even save the file I can download the file so that

04:05.780 --> 04:12.180
later on a week from now I can check up on the progress and see how my portfolio is doing.

04:13.600 --> 04:18.970
And now I hope you started to see the power that comes with this

04:21.830 --> 04:30.980
we've created an entire web platform ourselves we've created the ACM all CSX and JavaScript files while

04:31.070 --> 04:36.230
we use some templates but we still modified them to our liking and you can continue to update them and

04:36.230 --> 04:43.250
change them to your liking but we also created a server ourselves that also contains a CSA v file that

04:43.250 --> 04:50.720
will be saved on this machine and we move that machine from just our computers to someplace like Python

04:50.720 --> 04:58.500
anywhere that has a dedicated server or a server space for us so that it's always running.

04:58.850 --> 05:07.940
And this is how things like databases and places like a W S Google Cloud Azure and any other database

05:07.970 --> 05:10.370
or server platform works.

05:10.370 --> 05:12.500
They allow you to use their machine.

05:12.500 --> 05:18.540
They make sure that they're going to run fast that they're always going to be on and databases allow

05:18.540 --> 05:19.630
you to safe things.

05:19.740 --> 05:27.240
So instead of saving items in a CSP we can save it and into a dedicated database so we can do more operations

05:27.600 --> 05:30.290
or we can store more information.

05:30.450 --> 05:38.340
But I hope that opens up the world of web development to you and how everything is connected in just

05:38.730 --> 05:42.830
a few hours we're able to create a pretty neat looking portfolio.

05:42.900 --> 05:44.140
Right.

05:44.200 --> 05:50.470
I mean yeah there were some configuration some issues but now that you know how to do it I bet you see

05:50.470 --> 05:54.700
a whole lot of possibilities of what you can do.

05:54.700 --> 06:02.140
You can now customize the site whichever way you want maybe learn a little bit more HCM L or CSX to

06:02.200 --> 06:08.110
make the Web site a little bit more to your liking maybe you want to add some javascript to make it

06:08.110 --> 06:09.270
even more interactive.

06:10.260 --> 06:17.100
Or maybe you want to explore different things like perhaps hosting this application in someplace other

06:17.100 --> 06:24.280
than Python anyway or maybe creating your own database the possibilities are endless.

06:24.330 --> 06:26.700
So I hope this was exciting to you.

06:26.730 --> 06:33.620
This is one of my favorite topics and it was a lot of things that we covered in a short amount of time.

06:33.720 --> 06:39.870
You're not going to be an expert web developer just from a few videos but I hope this at least shows

06:39.870 --> 06:45.290
you the world of web development and how you might want to be involved in this world.

06:45.300 --> 06:47.130
Good job getting this far.

06:47.130 --> 06:48.900
This was a really tough section.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.000
If your brain hurts.

06:50.040 --> 06:50.730
Don't worry.

06:50.730 --> 06:54.220
Go take a nap and I'll see you in the next video.

06:54.220 --> 06:54.570
Bye bye.
