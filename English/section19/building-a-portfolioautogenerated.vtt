00:02.570 --> 00:05.090
So we've learned the basics of flask.

00:05.090 --> 00:10.040
We understand what servers do and we also know what browsers do.

00:10.040 --> 00:13.400
But let's be honest here this is kind of boring.

00:13.400 --> 00:17.590
I mean this is not impressive if you show this to a possible employer.

00:17.630 --> 00:20.730
They're going to look at you like a crazy person.

00:20.960 --> 00:28.030
So let's actually build a nice looking portfolio just based on what we've learned up until now.

00:28.040 --> 00:31.130
Now I have a little gift for you.

00:31.130 --> 00:38.180
That is the fact that you won't have to write your own HMO CSX and JavaScript because again this isn't

00:38.210 --> 00:39.970
a web development course.

00:40.040 --> 00:47.300
And luckily for us if you Google and you are online for something like free templates or a simple free

00:47.300 --> 00:55.070
templates you can find some really nice looking Web sites that you can just use for free.

00:55.140 --> 01:00.150
For example let's look at universe over here and I'll link to this resource so you can take a look for

01:00.150 --> 01:01.200
yourself as well.

01:01.200 --> 01:13.860
If I preview it check that out you have a nice little Web site or portfolio page that you can just use.

01:13.910 --> 01:15.210
How cool is that.

01:15.410 --> 01:20.340
And it's actually already tablet and mobile friendly.

01:20.510 --> 01:23.200
So everything is already pre-built for you.

01:24.090 --> 01:25.320
That's pretty cool right.

01:25.320 --> 01:27.710
So how can we use this.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.000
Well let's just download it.

01:30.090 --> 01:37.800
And by the way as you follow along you can actually use whichever one of these you want but for now

01:37.890 --> 01:42.540
let's just use the universe one just because there's a little astronaut here it looks pretty cool.

01:42.540 --> 01:45.650
Let's just download this and see what happens.

01:45.660 --> 01:45.960
All right.

01:45.990 --> 01:51.840
I get a little question saying how do we want to download that template in our case we want to pick

01:51.930 --> 01:55.050
a simple and there you go.

01:55.050 --> 01:59.190
We get a nice little zip folder and now we have this downloading.

01:59.610 --> 02:07.740
So let's open this up and oh boy that's a whole lot of files and folders.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.630
So what should we grab from here.

02:11.780 --> 02:13.980
Well there's a few things first.

02:14.030 --> 02:15.940
This is the sample page.

02:15.980 --> 02:19.590
We actually don't need this so let's just move it to trash.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.050
Next we have assets.

02:22.100 --> 02:28.670
These are well different assets for our page to work such as the astronaut page.

02:28.670 --> 02:29.780
So we'll keep that around

02:32.600 --> 02:42.860
and then we have our HDMI pages which we definitely need and then it looks like we have some javascript

02:42.860 --> 02:45.500
files and CSX files.

02:45.530 --> 02:52.790
Now there's a dot Jeezy here which is what we call a compressed file a g zipped compressed file.

02:53.210 --> 02:59.810
So this is just a way for the server to send a file or the javascript value which you can see is one

02:59.810 --> 03:03.030
hundred and thirty eight kilobytes but in a compressed form.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.790
So 44 kilobytes.

03:04.790 --> 03:09.620
So this way we're sending less data to the front end and then we also have something like map which

03:09.620 --> 03:15.050
actually helps us during debugging but in our case we don't need to worry about this for now.

03:15.110 --> 03:23.450
So let's just remove all the G's to and map files so we'll move those to trash so that we only have

03:23.490 --> 03:29.770
once the SS file and one JavaScript file and then all the other ones are HCM all files for our different

03:29.890 --> 03:31.670
pages.

03:31.750 --> 03:38.400
Now what we're going to do is we're going to copy this and move it to our project folder.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.760
Remember this folder over here.

03:40.760 --> 03:48.170
So ideally we move the HMO files into the templates and the static files.

03:48.170 --> 03:52.910
That is the CSF and JavaScript files and maybe the assets in here.

03:52.910 --> 03:55.280
So that is the images in here.

03:55.280 --> 03:56.470
So let's do that.

03:56.510 --> 03:58.890
I have my web server here.

03:59.000 --> 04:08.130
I'm going to first just copy and paste while we just copy and let's move all our HCM Mal files into

04:08.130 --> 04:12.200
our templates and you know what.

04:12.220 --> 04:16.290
Let's remove our existing templates as well because we don't need them anymore.

04:16.290 --> 04:24.490
We have the pretty atrium off on the and then just have all of these we have a new index that HMO that

04:24.490 --> 04:26.870
is going to be a lot prettier than our all Web site.

04:26.890 --> 04:29.080
So we want to use that.

04:29.170 --> 04:38.210
So let's move all that into templates and then let's do the J.S. and CSF file as well as the assets

04:38.330 --> 04:43.250
folder into the static awesome.

04:43.290 --> 04:48.640
So now that we have that setup let's go back to our project and look at that.

04:48.660 --> 04:55.220
We have a lot more HCM all that we have in Britain but luckily it's already created for us.

04:55.350 --> 05:04.590
Now the last bit of setup is that because we moved our files around we need to adjust the links between

05:04.590 --> 05:09.010
the ACM LCROSS javascript and all the asset files.

05:09.090 --> 05:19.520
So if we scroll which we go to index dot HMO we see that we're looking for the father con in assets

05:19.700 --> 05:31.100
fab icon but because this is in static folder we have to add static in here so let's find where else

05:31.160 --> 05:37.090
we're using the assets in here.

05:37.100 --> 05:45.150
All right so it looks like let's make this a little bit bigger so it looks like here for our background

05:45.150 --> 05:52.800
image we're once again looking for the space image but that's as we know in the static folder.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.040
And let's see where else we have.

05:55.040 --> 06:01.020
Well we have over here as well let's do static let's keep going.

06:01.130 --> 06:01.790
Static.

06:01.790 --> 06:02.060
All right.

06:02.060 --> 06:02.890
Everything is all good.

06:02.890 --> 06:10.610
Now we have the static folder and we have to make sure we add a slash in front of a dot dot just means

06:10.970 --> 06:14.380
current directory and then look in the static folder.

06:14.510 --> 06:16.210
So let's go back.

06:16.400 --> 06:19.390
Make sure we do that for everything.

06:19.400 --> 06:24.260
There we go and there we go.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.820
Now let's save this.

06:27.820 --> 06:37.440
And I don't think we're completely done yet but for now let's go into our server dot pi and for our

06:37.450 --> 06:47.650
home route let's remove what we've had before and let's just call it my home function.

06:48.050 --> 06:50.180
That takes no parameters.

06:50.420 --> 07:00.720
And instead it's just going to return for us our index dot A.T.M. with no past in parameters so let's

07:01.110 --> 07:12.560
save go back to our page or my Web site and see what we get when we refresh rate.

07:12.580 --> 07:19.480
That's a pretty pretty ugly Web site but it looks like at least we're displaying something.

07:20.230 --> 07:26.120
But right away we noticed that it looks like there's no CSX being applied.

07:26.290 --> 07:32.700
It looks like we have some mainstream all but the links aren't working either so once again this is

07:32.700 --> 07:36.760
because we have to update the links between the files.

07:36.890 --> 07:44.390
So what we'll do is actually go back to index start ECMO and in the head tag we see that we have our

07:45.450 --> 07:47.660
style sheet our CSX file.

07:47.880 --> 07:59.370
But again we have to update this to have it in the static folder as well as the javascript file which

07:59.370 --> 08:06.700
if we scroll all the way to the bottom we have the J.S. file here which once again will be in the static

08:06.940 --> 08:11.150
folder.

08:11.170 --> 08:18.320
All right let's save and go back and see if that makes things better.

08:18.440 --> 08:19.490
Look at that.

08:19.490 --> 08:21.320
That's pretty cool.

08:21.400 --> 08:27.310
Mind you this looks a little big because I increase the size of my web site by doing command plus and

08:27.310 --> 08:33.260
minus just so we can see better but that's pretty awesome.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.890
Now if I click on let's say works hmm.

08:36.170 --> 08:40.970
I get work workstation HMO does not exist.

08:41.060 --> 08:42.720
So how can we fix that.

08:42.740 --> 08:44.030
We already know how to do that.

08:44.060 --> 08:44.330
Right.

08:45.920 --> 08:52.980
All we need to do is to update these different routes so that it points to the appropriate template.

08:53.210 --> 08:55.180
Now in the next video I'll show you how to do that.

08:55.190 --> 09:00.260
But I want you to attempt to do this yourself because we've learned this by now.

09:00.260 --> 09:08.410
So try to make the Web site work exactly like we had it over here on our mash up templates and I'll

09:08.410 --> 09:09.520
see you in the next video.
