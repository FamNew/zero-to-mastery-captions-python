00:00.600 --> 00:01.480
All right.

00:01.490 --> 00:03.230
Were you able to get that.

00:03.250 --> 00:05.230
If not don't worry.

00:05.230 --> 00:11.590
Let's go over what we need to do to get everything on our profile working so we obviously have an about

00:11.920 --> 00:16.270
80 mile page so that can just stay the same as it is now.

00:16.300 --> 00:22.890
We can call it about and if we copy and paste here do a another one let's say.

00:23.020 --> 00:23.830
What else do we have.

00:23.830 --> 00:25.190
We have work done.

00:25.220 --> 00:30.160
She must allow us to work dot HMO which will be work dot HMO.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.470
And let's just check that this works.

00:32.470 --> 00:41.240
I'm going to remove the old rope just so we have the home about and work HMO if I go back and let's

00:41.240 --> 00:42.790
go to home.

00:42.800 --> 00:48.010
Well it looks like we have a bit of an air and I did not change the function over here you see that

00:48.020 --> 00:51.320
I have both about so let's just call this work.

00:51.350 --> 00:53.900
If I go back and refresh.

00:53.900 --> 00:56.970
All right let's go to works.

00:57.100 --> 01:01.130
Well it's a work start HMO wise than that working.

01:01.250 --> 01:03.370
That is because it should be works.

01:03.380 --> 01:04.760
Dot HMO.

01:04.860 --> 01:07.510
Silly me.

01:07.670 --> 01:08.750
Let's go back.

01:08.750 --> 01:12.520
Let's refresh works.

01:12.580 --> 01:13.070
All right.

01:13.230 --> 01:18.260
Is working but once again the CSX is not being applied.

01:18.410 --> 01:23.240
If I go back and let's go to about me about me is working as well.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.950
But the CSX isn't being applied.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.800
And we know why that is.

01:26.840 --> 01:34.860
Once again if we go to works we have to update this to include the static folder

01:40.990 --> 01:41.480
awesome.

01:41.530 --> 01:51.090
And then we update the CSX page as well as well as the javascript page.

01:51.120 --> 01:56.610
So this is a lot of repetition but I'm just showing you so you understand what the thought process is

01:56.610 --> 01:58.540
and why we need to do this again.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.350
We'll just fix this as well

02:05.430 --> 02:12.390
and this one feel like I should have a song in the background as I do this so you don't get bored of

02:12.390 --> 02:16.610
me just doing this over and over but repetition is good.

02:16.710 --> 02:17.610
Right.

02:17.610 --> 02:18.350
All right.

02:18.480 --> 02:29.890
Last one the javascript file let's save go back to our server let's refresh.

02:29.910 --> 02:30.330
All right.

02:30.390 --> 02:35.370
Let's go to home oh looks like index that HMO is not working.

02:35.370 --> 02:36.720
So we've got a fix that as well.

02:36.750 --> 02:42.320
We have the root directory that's working that click on works.

02:42.330 --> 02:42.790
Mm hmm.

02:42.810 --> 02:48.270
Looks like the CSF didn't work less about the C above me about me is working so we missed something

02:48.270 --> 02:49.610
and works.

02:49.610 --> 02:51.030
If we go back to

02:54.140 --> 02:57.600
0 and that's because we have a work and works a shitty amount.

02:57.700 --> 03:02.660
So we have to make sure that we incorporate the works a small set of the work one.

03:02.710 --> 03:08.560
Not sure what this page does but I'm sure it's part of part of this.

03:08.570 --> 03:15.990
So again going into our works HMO doing the same thing we've been doing adding the static

03:21.420 --> 03:22.200
like so

03:25.450 --> 03:32.640
and all the way at the bottom for the javascript file as well let's go back.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.040
Go to works and hooray.

03:35.050 --> 03:41.890
Look at that all our works are being displayed but it looks like some of the images are not displaying

03:44.150 --> 03:44.360
now.

03:44.360 --> 03:47.710
Can you guess why that is well.

03:47.770 --> 03:56.550
If we go back to our works HMO and we look for images

04:00.750 --> 04:09.380
we see that here we have to add the static as well so again I'll add those to the images and just to

04:09.380 --> 04:17.840
make this faster I'll just copy this and do command f or control F to search for all instances of images

04:18.620 --> 04:23.530
and make sure that we add the assets in here an easy way of doing this.

04:23.540 --> 04:31.010
And this is what an I.D. can help you with or a text editor like Sublime Text is I can select the entire

04:31.010 --> 04:42.380
thing like this and do command control G and this actually selects all the instances and I have now

04:42.410 --> 04:44.330
multiple cursors.

04:44.330 --> 04:53.990
Now what I can do now is just add the static on all the instances as you can see at the bottom and the

04:53.990 --> 04:59.820
top here as well so that I don't have to repeat myself.

04:59.830 --> 05:03.500
Now let's go back refresh hand look at that.

05:03.720 --> 05:11.890
We have our projects displaying that's really really cool and just like that we have our templates now.

05:11.920 --> 05:17.590
We still have the components that we need to fix and the contact.

05:17.700 --> 05:25.170
Now the components we actually don't need because if you go to the preview here the components is just

05:25.170 --> 05:30.880
in a Schimmel template that you can just copy and paste based on what components you need.

05:31.110 --> 05:33.750
But we don't actually need that on our real portfolio.

05:33.750 --> 05:39.240
The only other one that we need is the contact page which is really really important because we're going

05:39.240 --> 05:50.700
to use that for our Python server so let's go back here let's remove the components dot ECMO or for

05:50.700 --> 05:52.100
now we can just keep it there.

05:52.110 --> 06:02.280
But in the index that 80 mile file we can go all the way down and in the navigation bar section you

06:02.280 --> 06:09.990
see over here how we have the components dot HMO we can just remove that just like that so we're not

06:09.990 --> 06:11.870
using it.

06:12.090 --> 06:22.520
Now one thing you may have seen me do is copy and paste code so that now we would have to do a another

06:22.520 --> 06:26.610
route that says contact and then once again do contact.

06:26.780 --> 06:32.670
But this is us repeating code based on what we've learned can we improve this.

06:32.750 --> 06:39.350
So this becomes more dynamic so that maybe when we add a new HDMI file to this profile we don't have

06:39.350 --> 06:45.570
to constantly just copy and paste the same code over and over try that and in the next video I'll show

06:45.570 --> 06:46.590
you how we can do that.
