WEBVTT

00:00.650 --> 00:03.680
So how do Web sites work.

00:03.680 --> 00:05.900
Now I have an entire web development course.

00:05.900 --> 00:12.290
So because this is a Python course we're not going to go super super deep into this topic.

00:12.290 --> 00:15.240
Instead we're going to focus on the Python side of things.

00:15.380 --> 00:21.800
But I do want to help you understand what we're building and how everything works because hopefully

00:21.800 --> 00:28.040
by the end of this course you're able to actually change your portfolio update your portfolio to your

00:28.040 --> 00:34.300
own liking and showcase the projects that we've built throughout the course so I have a Web site for

00:34.300 --> 00:34.540
you.

00:34.530 --> 00:43.750
Here we have x k C.D. which is just a little funny comic Web site if I click refresh here or enter this

00:43.750 --> 00:47.020
U.R.L. I'm taken to this Web site.

00:47.030 --> 00:49.830
But how does this actually work.

00:49.870 --> 00:56.810
How is my browser in this case Google Chrome able to display this web page for me.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.390
I need to be connected to the Internet right.

00:59.440 --> 01:04.620
So there's some sort of data that's being transferred for me to be able to see this.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.600
So let's explore how this works.

01:07.600 --> 01:13.580
And look at that I created a nice little diagram for you and in this diagram I'm going to attempt to

01:13.640 --> 01:15.810
just tell you exactly how it works.

01:15.830 --> 01:17.420
It's quite simple.

01:17.420 --> 01:24.000
We have our browser right here which can be Google Chrome it could be safari could be Firefox.

01:24.110 --> 01:27.590
It doesn't matter this browser.

01:27.590 --> 01:34.350
We're able to type into it a Web site or maybe google for a Web site and then click on a Web site when

01:34.350 --> 01:37.280
we click on a Web site.

01:37.290 --> 01:46.380
What happens is that through internet the browser makes a request all the way to another machine and

01:46.380 --> 01:52.440
this machine which we call a server is located anywhere in the world.

01:52.470 --> 02:00.690
It doesn't really matter because through our internet network the browser is going to say hey this Web

02:00.690 --> 02:01.580
site.

02:01.890 --> 02:09.470
Who owns that Web site or which machine can serve me the files for that Web site and using some complex

02:09.470 --> 02:10.320
logic.

02:10.550 --> 02:16.490
It's going to find this server which at the end of the day is just a computer.

02:16.490 --> 02:19.770
And we're actually going to show you and deploy our own server.

02:19.880 --> 02:27.560
Well it simply says hey give me some data because without data I'm not able to display anything on a

02:27.560 --> 02:28.190
web page.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.480
And the server.

02:30.610 --> 02:35.680
Well first of all they communicate over something called a CTP and a.

02:35.690 --> 02:41.500
S because the browser and the server are two different machines.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.230
Right.

02:42.250 --> 02:50.860
The browser is on my laptop right now and the machine which is a server it can be anywhere in the world

02:52.240 --> 02:54.790
they need to communicate some way.

02:54.790 --> 03:00.850
And we need a rule to say you know we don't want all these machines talking to each other with no rules

03:00.880 --> 03:01.760
in place.

03:01.840 --> 03:07.980
For example we can agree that when we communicate between you and I I'm going to speak in English in

03:07.990 --> 03:16.870
the same way a GDP and a GDP yes which is a secured encrypted version of communication allows me to

03:16.870 --> 03:26.300
say hey can you give me the data and the server to understand oh this Web site or this browser needs

03:26.360 --> 03:36.290
the data that I have if I go back to this Web site over here you see that I'm using a G.P.S. and it's

03:36.290 --> 03:39.440
saying I want to use the HECS protocol.

03:39.440 --> 03:44.800
That is the language to communicate that I want to go to this Web site.

03:44.840 --> 03:51.470
So as soon as I hit enter it's going to make that request all the way to a server somewhere and then

03:51.470 --> 03:59.260
the server is going to respond with this data let's continue with our diagram so the request has just

03:59.260 --> 04:00.190
been made.

04:00.250 --> 04:06.040
This server just happens to have three files that we need.

04:06.040 --> 04:12.260
One is an HCM Mal file and this file is the text or content of the Web site.

04:12.340 --> 04:19.000
The other one is the C assess file and this contains all the styling of the Web site.

04:19.030 --> 04:24.400
So that is colors maybe some fonts maybe the position of the elements.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.620
Anything to do with style.

04:25.630 --> 04:28.850
So doesn't look like a boring piece of text.

04:29.020 --> 04:34.630
And then we have Javascript javascript is what gives Web sites behavior.

04:34.690 --> 04:41.890
When I log into Facebook or maybe tweet something on Twitter javascript is allowing me to perform those

04:41.890 --> 04:51.160
actions because with just a shemale and CSX we just have text and some pretty styling with JavaScript

04:51.250 --> 04:55.600
we're able to take actions but we don't need to focus on that too much.

04:55.600 --> 05:04.150
All we need to know is that this server because it's a computer on its files has these three files for

05:04.150 --> 05:12.130
us and these three files what happened gets sent to the browser because the browser was really really

05:12.130 --> 05:17.440
kind and asked hey can you give me data and the server says Sure.

05:17.440 --> 05:23.490
Here it is and sends us these three files in these three files when they get sent back.

05:23.530 --> 05:30.630
The browser understands them and because it understands them even though to us it may look like gibberish

05:30.870 --> 05:34.400
it's able to display that Web site for us.

05:34.470 --> 05:36.130
But let me ask you a question.

05:36.180 --> 05:39.900
Up until now I haven't really talked about Python.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.690
I thought this was a Python course Andre.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.750
Were you telling me all this stuff that I don't care about.

05:44.760 --> 05:51.140
Well because in here there's one piece that can actually be written in Python.

05:51.180 --> 05:52.810
Can you guess what that is.

05:53.870 --> 05:59.910
If you guessed the server congratulations you get five thousand points.

06:00.140 --> 06:05.750
You see the browser is something that while it's an application we download on our computer.

06:05.800 --> 06:15.470
Right but up until now the server was kind of a mystery box a machine a computer somewhere but Python

06:15.470 --> 06:23.440
programmers can actually write the logic and the rules that servers can act upon.

06:23.450 --> 06:31.400
So all this communication of Hey can you give me data can be interpreted in Python and then send this

06:31.400 --> 06:39.700
data to the browser using Python and we're going to build our own server over the next couple of videos

06:39.970 --> 06:46.780
but also touch upon these HMRC SS and JavaScript files so we can actually display something like a Web

06:46.780 --> 06:47.820
site.

06:47.830 --> 06:51.200
Now I want to finish off this video with one question.

06:51.460 --> 06:56.860
Do you think that this server has to be written in Python.

06:56.950 --> 06:57.550
What do you think.

06:58.420 --> 06:59.550
No it doesn't.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.240
Right.

07:00.250 --> 07:04.340
The browser doesn't care what this machine is like.

07:04.360 --> 07:14.290
All it cares about is these three files and because we're speaking in this HDP HDP as protocol the browser

07:14.290 --> 07:17.010
says hey I don't care what language you speak.

07:17.050 --> 07:18.130
I don't care anything.

07:18.340 --> 07:25.240
I'm just going to tell you through this AC G.P.S. just give me the data that I want and we can do whatever

07:25.240 --> 07:32.050
logic we want in here I can send e-mails from here if I want I can send text messages I can do math

07:32.050 --> 07:35.510
operations I can play a game on this computer if I want.

07:35.530 --> 07:43.180
It doesn't really matter as long as I am able to send these files back to the browser so we can do that

07:43.180 --> 07:50.880
with Python but we can do that with other languages like node like P. HP like Java.

07:51.910 --> 07:55.160
So we can write a server in any type of language.

07:55.220 --> 08:01.330
The only thing we can really do is on the browser side on the browser side we have to use these three

08:01.330 --> 08:08.110
files because while at least in general terms it can only understand javascript which is another programming

08:08.110 --> 08:09.450
language.

08:09.460 --> 08:12.760
All right let's explore this topic a little bit more in the next video.
