00:00.560 --> 00:07.640
In the previous video we learned that a browser simply sends a request to a server somewhere in the

00:07.640 --> 00:17.210
world over internet using the HDP s protocol and then it receives those javascript AML and c assessed

00:17.210 --> 00:21.870
files so that it's able to display a Web site.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.330
Now how can we actually check this.

00:25.370 --> 00:32.780
Well I can actually go to view developer and this is using Google Chrome.

00:32.780 --> 00:37.570
So I recommend for this part to use Google Chrome so you can follow what I'm doing.

00:37.730 --> 00:45.450
If I go to developer tools here it's going to open up a little box here with some information for me.

00:46.560 --> 00:54.930
Now what I want to focus on is this network tab and this network tab is going to tell us what type of

00:54.930 --> 00:57.860
information we receive from the server.

00:58.020 --> 01:04.770
If I refresh here you'll notice that I get some data here.

01:04.820 --> 01:07.250
Now you want to make sure that there's no filter involved.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.430
So we want to say over here that we want everything.

01:10.430 --> 01:12.740
So there's no filter everything.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.750
There's no searching going on.

01:14.750 --> 01:16.700
And we can refresh again.

01:16.700 --> 01:17.960
And all right.

01:17.960 --> 01:23.240
We see a lot more files but this looks intimidating.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.150
Let's think about what we just learned.

01:25.370 --> 01:33.040
We learned that we first get an A CML file which happens to be this one.

01:33.050 --> 01:35.530
It says over here type document.

01:35.530 --> 01:39.590
And if I click over here this is an HMO document.

01:39.890 --> 01:46.550
So the response from the server when I hit refresh remember it communicated to a server somewhere in

01:46.550 --> 01:50.420
the world that had these files on that computer.

01:50.420 --> 01:53.720
And here we have our 80 mile file.

01:53.720 --> 02:01.370
If I'll scroll down look at that we can see over here the webcomic of romance sarcasm math and language

02:02.000 --> 02:03.820
which is right over here.

02:03.920 --> 02:10.070
Remember how I said A.T.M. is the text that gets displayed on a Web site.

02:10.760 --> 02:17.480
Well this is our HCM all here that the server responded with and the browser knows how to read this

02:17.840 --> 02:21.160
and display the text.

02:21.180 --> 02:22.500
What about the CSF.

02:22.950 --> 02:29.940
Well I can actually click on this CSF step here and show me all the CFS files that came from the server

02:31.180 --> 02:35.050
you see over here that this again looks a little bit different.

02:35.140 --> 02:41.500
It's in a different syntax than an HMO but all it does here is it gives me the stylus that I want.

02:41.500 --> 02:44.060
You can see over here we can pick background color.

02:44.170 --> 02:48.910
We can pick different position with left position.

02:48.910 --> 02:57.570
And this gives us the styling that we want on a Web site and then if we go to JavaScript we actually

02:57.570 --> 03:02.710
see the JavaScript files that this Web site uses.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.270
Now we don't have to worry about JavaScript here.

03:05.430 --> 03:09.280
JavaScript allows us to do some interactivity on this Web site.

03:09.270 --> 03:11.820
That for now we probably don't need to worry about.

03:12.120 --> 03:18.090
Now I do want to point out that there's a few other things in here like image and media and as you can

03:18.090 --> 03:24.330
see images we definitely have some images in here that we are using click on preview we can see the

03:24.330 --> 03:25.390
images.

03:25.620 --> 03:29.610
But at the end of the day the concept is the same.

03:29.670 --> 03:36.580
We have an HMO file which in our case is right over here.

03:36.590 --> 03:43.370
You see how the ACM all file is displayed without CSX which is just the textual textual data.

03:43.370 --> 03:53.060
We have the CSX which is the styling of our page and there's some javascript to make our page interactive

03:53.720 --> 03:55.150
and maybe some images.

03:55.250 --> 04:02.630
But at the end of the day all these things are actually just textual data that we receive from the server.

04:02.630 --> 04:09.470
So that means that in order for us to be able to build our Web site we need to create these three things

04:10.260 --> 04:14.920
an Asian male file a CSX file and a javascript file.

04:14.990 --> 04:18.880
Actually we don't even need a javascript file if we don't want any interactivity.

04:18.950 --> 04:22.820
We don't even need a CSX file if we don't want any styling.

04:22.820 --> 04:25.510
We can even just use an Asian alpha.

04:25.580 --> 04:28.970
So in the next video we're going to build our first Web site.

04:28.970 --> 04:30.300
I'll see on that one.

04:30.350 --> 04:30.610
Bobby.
