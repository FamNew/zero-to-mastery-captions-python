00:00.510 --> 00:01.510
Welcome back.

00:01.530 --> 00:05.180
Let's make this a little bit more dynamic.

00:05.200 --> 00:06.790
We have our home wrote.

00:06.970 --> 00:12.760
But for all the other Asian male pages I'll be nice if this was generated dynamically so that we don't

00:12.760 --> 00:21.520
have to copy and paste code so let's delete all of these and instead use this little syntax that we

00:21.520 --> 00:26.910
learned about where we can dynamically accept different U.R.L. parameters.

00:26.980 --> 00:29.680
In this case we can just call it page name.

00:30.640 --> 00:36.310
And this page name should be a string right.

00:36.320 --> 00:42.040
So now we can use the string type to say I want the page name.

00:42.140 --> 00:51.430
So this is going to be a simple page and we want to render in the template the data that was entered

00:51.430 --> 01:05.860
in the U.R.L. so we can actually give it the page name here as the input and print out the page name

01:05.860 --> 01:07.620
here.

01:07.880 --> 01:18.160
Let's see if this works I'm going to save this go back to our home page and it works what if I do works.

01:18.270 --> 01:18.710
Look at that.

01:19.160 --> 01:23.470
If I go to about me about me works contact.

01:23.520 --> 01:23.850
All right.

01:23.850 --> 01:26.520
Contact is working but the CSF isn't being applied.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.720
So we have to update that and we still see the components.

01:30.720 --> 01:30.920
All right.

01:30.930 --> 01:35.930
So there's a few things that we need to fix but everything is working dynamically which is great.

01:35.940 --> 01:42.300
And you see that even index that Asia amount that we had issues with before is now working which is

01:42.300 --> 01:43.110
great.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.740
So let's fix a few things.

01:45.780 --> 01:54.540
We've now made our code super simple and easy to understand but there is a few bugs that we need to

01:54.540 --> 01:56.060
fix in our code.

01:56.070 --> 01:59.280
First is to remove the components.

01:59.300 --> 02:04.610
Now the reason this is happening is that each page if we screw up to the top.

02:04.610 --> 02:09.390
So let's go to the about page has the components link.

02:09.390 --> 02:12.780
So from each page we just have to remove the components.

02:12.780 --> 02:20.290
So let's go to contact remove the components here go to index.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.390
We've already removed the components for that one.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.500
If I go to work Work is a little bit different.

02:27.710 --> 02:29.130
We'll get back to that in a second.

02:29.150 --> 02:36.590
If we go to works and again at the top and the navigation the components we can just remove just like

02:36.590 --> 02:38.250
that.

02:38.380 --> 02:43.150
We also saw that the context page does I have CSX added to it.

02:43.150 --> 02:49.240
So again we go back and we add the static

02:52.670 --> 02:53.580
folder here.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.760
Same with the fab icon

02:58.800 --> 03:03.490
right over here and then the javascript file at the bottom

03:08.340 --> 03:12.110
if we save go back let's refresh

03:14.920 --> 03:21.050
and go to home if we go to works that works about me that works.

03:21.050 --> 03:21.810
Contact.

03:21.830 --> 03:28.010
Look at that how pretty is that all right now a few things that I want to fix here.

03:28.040 --> 03:31.940
One is that we see that the numbers don't match over here.

03:31.940 --> 03:36.170
We want them to ideally match rate.

03:36.170 --> 03:40.820
So we have this working but then about me and contact.

03:40.880 --> 03:41.980
That's kind of weird.

03:41.990 --> 03:43.430
Let's see why that is.

03:43.660 --> 03:50.620
If we go back we go to contact we see that in the navigation.

03:50.650 --> 03:57.700
We have one two three four which looks great but then at the bottom we see that the numbers contact

03:57.700 --> 04:00.330
me are a little bit off.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.590
So let's just do 0 4 4.

04:02.590 --> 04:11.610
Contact me if we go to about making sure that the about page or about me is 0 3.

04:11.620 --> 04:13.660
So let's do that.

04:13.660 --> 04:22.020
And now if I save and refresh we have contact me about me works and hope.

04:22.060 --> 04:22.560
All right.

04:22.600 --> 04:23.550
Two last things.

04:23.590 --> 04:27.160
And then we're going to get back to Python I promise one.

04:27.190 --> 04:34.030
I want to change this text so that it says my name and maybe I'm a python developer.

04:34.750 --> 04:45.180
So all we have to do is once again go to index dot A.T.M. and look for this text ad your site or app

04:45.210 --> 04:49.880
content here so we can see here it says Hello I'm James Dean French designer.

04:49.890 --> 05:01.610
So let's just say I'm Andre Natalie and let's say Python let's say expert sounds cooler working as a

05:01.610 --> 05:04.370
freelancer let's do an instructor.

05:04.390 --> 05:05.830
Because I am an instructor after all

05:10.280 --> 05:18.610
so that if I save and refresh How awesome is that super super simple.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.080
That looks pretty neat.

05:21.190 --> 05:21.370
All right.

05:21.370 --> 05:23.630
The last thing is the works part.

05:23.890 --> 05:28.240
If you look at my works and I click on discover.

05:28.240 --> 05:28.570
All right.

05:28.570 --> 05:33.100
So here you can add your own projects that you want.

05:33.100 --> 05:41.140
If I go to 0 6 I guess the links you're under aren't working since we only have one work.

05:41.140 --> 05:44.140
But let's say you wanted to add a different project.

05:44.140 --> 05:52.710
All we have to do is simply say work to dot HMO and link in 0 0 to here with work to.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.580
Let me show you how that's done.

05:54.580 --> 05:59.070
So let's go to work that HMO if we do.

05:59.070 --> 06:01.650
Control f and do 0 0 2.

06:02.190 --> 06:04.080
We see that these are the links.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.670
Look at that 0 0 2 0 0 3.

06:06.690 --> 06:15.420
So all we have to do is perhaps change the link here to work to dot HP AML so that it links to work

06:15.420 --> 06:16.110
too.

06:16.170 --> 06:18.660
Now that's something that you can do on your own.

06:18.660 --> 06:24.030
Again we don't want to focus too much on a sham on CSX because it's outside the scope of this course

06:25.210 --> 06:30.510
but as you can see we have a pretty neat Web site pretty fast.

06:30.520 --> 06:36.520
It only took us a couple of minutes and you now have a portfolio what page.

06:36.640 --> 06:43.870
But there is one big piece missing and one thing that python can really help us with that is this contact

06:44.080 --> 06:45.090
form.

06:45.490 --> 06:50.800
It wouldn't be a real portfolio Web site unless people can contact you right.

06:50.800 --> 06:56.590
Maybe employers or people that need work down can actually send you a message.

06:56.740 --> 07:02.650
So over the next couple of videos we're actually going to explore this where we're able to send information

07:03.100 --> 07:08.360
to our server and the backend and actually capture it and save it and store it somewhere.

07:09.190 --> 07:10.800
I'll see in the next one by.
