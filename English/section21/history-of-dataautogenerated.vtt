One thing that I really like doing in my courses is to actually understand the why of everything.

00:08.070 --> 00:11.720
Everything that we learn there should be a reason we're learning it right.

00:11.940 --> 00:17.340
And you might be asking yourself a why do we even care about machine learning how is that useful and

00:17.640 --> 00:19.440
how do we get here.

00:19.440 --> 00:28.410
Well if you think about a business because most technology evolves from business needs we have the advent

00:28.620 --> 00:36.300
of computers and the ability for businesses to use computers to do things really really fast and efficiently

00:36.660 --> 00:38.350
so that they gain an edge.

00:38.550 --> 00:45.480
And then we got spreadsheets spreadsheets like Excel files and CSP files were amazing because we can

00:45.480 --> 00:53.550
store data that businesses generate such as maybe customers customer data into an excel file and then

00:53.550 --> 01:02.160
people got really really good at analyzing these CSP files these spreadsheets to make business decisions.

01:02.160 --> 01:09.200
Maybe forecasting that December sales are going to be high because while the past two years we've had

01:09.210 --> 01:16.780
really high December sales because of Christmas and then as companies got more and more data we started

01:16.810 --> 01:23.650
getting this idea of the relational databases spreadsheets were great CSP files were great but we started

01:23.650 --> 01:31.480
getting more and more information and data and we needed a better way to organize things to understand

01:31.480 --> 01:33.260
things from our data.

01:33.310 --> 01:41.380
That's when we got things like my askew El which allowed us instead of using spreadsheets to use a language

01:41.380 --> 01:48.430
called ask you well to read information from our database right information to our database but similar

01:48.430 --> 01:56.320
to spreadsheets use the data that we gathered from the business to make business decisions so that our

01:56.320 --> 01:59.240
business becomes even more profitable.

01:59.380 --> 02:09.900
And then in 2000 we had this fancy term of big data we had big companies like Facebook Amazon Twitter

02:11.000 --> 02:18.920
Google that started accumulating more and more data an insane amount of data that you simply couldn't

02:18.920 --> 02:21.020
contain in a spreadsheet.

02:21.110 --> 02:31.020
User actions user likes user purchasing histories this idea of big data meant that we had so much data

02:31.050 --> 02:38.910
these companies had so much data and sometimes unlike relational databases which had to be a structured

02:38.970 --> 02:45.960
form of data sometimes we got really messy unstructured data and that's where we started getting this

02:45.960 --> 02:53.700
idea of no Eskew well where things like Mongo D.B. came into existence where you can store unstructured

02:53.700 --> 02:57.890
data and hopefully make business decisions out of that.

02:58.530 --> 03:06.180
Maybe if you were Amazon you can use customers purchasing history to recommend different products.

03:06.180 --> 03:15.030
And ever since then this idea of data getting more and more data has turned us into using machine learning

03:16.030 --> 03:23.380
because at some point we have so much data that as humans we can't just look like we did at spreadsheets

03:24.010 --> 03:27.890
and look at columns Ambrose and make business decisions.

03:28.050 --> 03:34.320
I mean we still could but then we'd be wasting all this data that we've been getting over the years.

03:34.320 --> 03:40.020
So companies like Facebook and Google that collect massive amounts of data every single day are turning

03:40.020 --> 03:45.720
to things like machine learning so that instead of humans looking at the data and trying to figure things

03:45.720 --> 03:52.170
out we give this data to machines so that they're better able even better than humans to make business

03:52.260 --> 03:53.390
decisions.

03:53.520 --> 03:59.220
And this idea of machine learning really came to be because of this growth in data that we received

03:59.220 --> 04:07.740
from businesses as well as the improvements in CPE use GP use that is graphical processing units and

04:07.740 --> 04:09.240
computer advancements.

04:09.360 --> 04:17.130
So using the massive amounts of data and massive improvements in computation we can use these machines

04:17.310 --> 04:24.680
to give them this big data and make decision for us just like we used to with spreadsheets now.

04:24.750 --> 04:32.950
This is a simplified version of how we got here but I hope it gives you a reason as to why businesses

04:33.400 --> 04:38.530
like this idea of machine learning I'll see in the next video by.
