00:00.870 --> 00:01.860
All right all right.

00:01.860 --> 00:06.690
I think it's time for us to actually start practicing some of these skills instead of just talking about

00:06.690 --> 00:12.450
theory because I know right now everything looks super complicated.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.170
You think that to be a machine learning expert.

00:15.420 --> 00:21.690
You have to have a PHC and you have to be really really smart with math and statistics but often that's

00:21.690 --> 00:23.600
not really the case.

00:23.610 --> 00:30.600
So in this video I want to show you what it actually means to do machine learning or data science.

00:31.170 --> 00:34.070
So in this machine learning one to one.

00:34.110 --> 00:38.270
Let's talk about what a machine learning expert does.

00:38.400 --> 00:43.980
The first thing that a person does is to usually import

00:46.660 --> 00:54.190
that is we have some sort of a CSP file and we're going to import that data and we know how to do that

00:54.190 --> 00:55.270
with Python right.

00:55.270 --> 01:01.240
We import a CSP data file so that we can use it in our program.

01:01.240 --> 01:01.780
And don't worry.

01:01.810 --> 01:09.220
These are the steps that we're actually going to show you when we do our upcoming projects.

01:09.220 --> 01:11.900
So the first thing is to import the data.

01:12.160 --> 01:15.480
Next what do we do.

01:15.500 --> 01:21.540
Well we clean the data that is in an ideal world.

01:21.590 --> 01:31.310
We have perfect data all the columns all the rows of a CSP file are filled in and everything is perfect.

01:31.430 --> 01:33.580
But that's often not the case.

01:33.590 --> 01:36.680
Sometimes you have missing labels.

01:36.680 --> 01:43.400
Sometimes you have missing cells or data and sometimes we have just unusable data that's really really

01:43.400 --> 01:44.090
bad.

01:44.090 --> 01:51.410
So we ideally clean the data so that when we use it later on it's not going to give us any errors or

01:51.410 --> 01:53.290
make bad predictions.

01:53.390 --> 01:58.520
Now number three what does a machine learning expert do.

01:58.520 --> 02:05.070
Well we split the data and this is an interesting one.

02:05.170 --> 02:14.800
We usually split the data into what we call a training set and a test set.

02:14.830 --> 02:22.530
What does this mean well splitting the data simply means just deciding we have let's say a hundred rows

02:22.650 --> 02:32.280
of excel and we decide that the 80 rows are going to be our training set while we give the machine to

02:32.280 --> 02:33.210
learn from.

02:33.210 --> 02:40.380
And then the last 20 rows are going to be the test set because we have to tell the machine whether it

02:40.380 --> 02:42.460
got the answer right or wrong.

02:42.540 --> 02:50.090
So we need a way for us to test with our pre-existing data whether our model is good or bad.

02:50.130 --> 02:52.170
Again this is something that we'll explore.

02:52.170 --> 02:57.550
But usually you split your data your Excel sheet into a training set.

02:57.570 --> 03:04.560
What we use as input and then the test set what we use to test the output that that machine learning

03:04.560 --> 03:10.740
function gives us and that's really easy to do we just decide hey 80 percent of the data is going to

03:10.740 --> 03:17.020
be training set and 20 percent is the test set up until now these three things are pretty easy right.

03:17.040 --> 03:26.280
And as we'll see they are quite easy next is we create a model.

03:26.300 --> 03:26.780
All right.

03:26.780 --> 03:29.260
This one sounds really really hard right.

03:29.270 --> 03:35.570
We just went from splitting data to all the set and we're creating this function this model that our

03:35.570 --> 03:37.500
program creates.

03:37.580 --> 03:46.310
But the funny thing is is that most likely what you do when you create a model is to import an algorithm

03:46.640 --> 03:50.020
you're not going to write the algorithm from scratch yourself.

03:50.240 --> 03:58.040
Usually you use a library like cycle learn which we're actually going to use to simply do an import

03:58.280 --> 04:05.960
and then decide what algorithm you want to use like decision trees or K nearest neighbor and we'll actually

04:05.960 --> 04:09.290
see how to do that in an upcoming exercise.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.760
So that's really nice.

04:10.760 --> 04:18.290
Somebody has already built an algorithm for us that creates the model based on our training set and

04:18.710 --> 04:26.420
the running joke is that when people think about machine learning expert they think of all these mathematical

04:26.420 --> 04:33.440
equations that people do but most of the time it's people just simply importing from a library an algorithm

04:33.740 --> 04:36.460
that's a one liner next.

04:37.010 --> 04:42.980
What do you think we do well we check the output right.

04:43.010 --> 04:45.650
We create the model that is the function.

04:45.650 --> 04:54.560
We have the input which is the training set and then we check the output of this model with our test

04:54.980 --> 04:57.260
set so the test set.

04:57.290 --> 05:05.470
We're going to say hey is the output matching what we expected so once we check the output what do we

05:05.470 --> 05:09.320
do while we improve.

05:09.320 --> 05:14.900
So most likely the first time around it's not going to get it completely right.

05:14.900 --> 05:21.350
So based on a test set we say hey we can probably improve something so as a machine learning expert

05:21.830 --> 05:24.350
you might give it extra inputs.

05:24.350 --> 05:31.250
That is maybe an extra column in the Excel file or you might want to change the model or the algorithm

05:31.250 --> 05:34.820
that you used to create this model.

05:34.820 --> 05:35.570
That's it.

05:35.570 --> 05:40.620
These are the six steps of what you do and you just repeat these steps.

05:40.640 --> 05:45.830
Now we'll come back to these and I'll link to this in the resource so that you can always have it in

05:45.830 --> 05:46.700
the back of your mind.

05:47.450 --> 05:51.690
But right now you just learn something really really fundamental.

05:52.070 --> 05:54.040
You see Facebook here.

05:54.110 --> 05:58.820
This is pretty much how they run their machine learning pipeline.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.980
And this diagram now should make sense.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.750
Just on those six steps that we talked about we define their goals.

06:06.770 --> 06:09.860
That is what do we want to accomplish.

06:09.980 --> 06:20.430
We gather the data we pass the data that is we clean it we split it into training data and testing data.

06:20.480 --> 06:27.680
We then do model creation and we experiment with different algorithms and then we finally test our data

06:27.890 --> 06:37.350
see how accurate it is based on our testing data and then we just go back and try different things until

06:37.500 --> 06:43.920
our model or our function is in line with what we defined as a goal.

06:43.920 --> 06:44.830
Isn't that cool.

06:44.880 --> 06:50.670
You just learn how Facebook is machine learning structure works.

06:50.700 --> 06:54.370
Now let me ask you one question before I end this video.

06:54.480 --> 06:58.610
What do you think the hardest part of this entire process is.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.680
I made it sound very very easy right.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.010
Think about it.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.120
Ready for the answer.

07:05.150 --> 07:13.520
The hardest part is actually grabbing the data because the more data we have the better the more inputs

07:13.520 --> 07:14.140
we have.

07:14.210 --> 07:22.560
The more training sets we can have so that we can improve the model and yes we can decide what algorithm

07:22.560 --> 07:28.050
to use to create a model what inputs to use during the training set.

07:28.050 --> 07:35.690
But the more data we have the more options we have as machine learning experts and it's really tough

07:35.690 --> 07:43.580
to collect good data or what we call data set and companies like Google and Facebook are really really

07:43.580 --> 07:52.340
valuable because they're the only ones that can collect that much data and that's why machine learning

07:52.670 --> 07:59.750
is pioneered by these companies that have large sets of data because you and I just simply don't have

07:59.750 --> 08:04.340
enough data to really make machine learning worth it.

08:04.340 --> 08:09.950
Most companies don't actually need machine learning or can even implement good machine learning because

08:10.010 --> 08:11.760
they don't have enough data.

08:12.020 --> 08:19.280
You need big companies like Amazon to use machine learning because they're the only ones to have access

08:19.280 --> 08:24.320
to that data and that's why they're so valuable they can share their model.

08:24.320 --> 08:30.440
They don't care but they usually keep their data private because that's what gives them a competitive

08:30.470 --> 08:31.850
advantage.

08:31.850 --> 08:32.210
All right.

08:32.330 --> 08:35.210
So now we know the steps of machine learning.

08:35.420 --> 08:42.230
The next is to learn what tools we can use to do these steps so that we can finally start learning and

08:42.230 --> 08:45.770
building our own machine learning models.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.720
I'll see in the next one by.
