00:00.390 --> 00:03.080
Holy moly we did it.

00:03.120 --> 00:05.030
That wasn't too bad was it.

00:05.040 --> 00:11.820
I mean there's a lot of new concept and machine learning is a big big topic that could be a whole course

00:11.880 --> 00:13.100
in its own.

00:13.230 --> 00:19.220
But I hope I was able to narrow down the essence of machine learning so you understand what's happening

00:19.230 --> 00:28.340
when people talk about M.L. we're simply doing these steps and we've learned about all of these steps

00:28.520 --> 00:37.770
so that now you can start to improve on them and learn how to perhaps improve at each step of the way.

00:37.820 --> 00:43.010
Now I've created a little notebook here that you can actually follow.

00:43.010 --> 00:52.850
I even have done some visualizations for you here using map plot lib to show you some of the iris dataset

00:53.330 --> 00:55.740
and kind of explore it on your own.

00:56.690 --> 01:06.170
But the key here is that you use Jupiter notebooks to visualize data to manipulate data to clean data

01:06.710 --> 01:14.780
and then slowly as you start to learn about your data you start making predictions to test your data

01:15.410 --> 01:23.990
to train your model on this dataset and hopefully get it to the point where you can make some important

01:24.020 --> 01:26.060
business decisions.

01:26.060 --> 01:34.160
Now this iris dataset isn't necessarily useful to somebody like Amazon or Google but using these basic

01:34.160 --> 01:42.860
principles you now have the ability to increase the ability of a model from just detecting flower types

01:43.220 --> 01:54.620
to detecting all sorts of images image recognitions self-driving cars all use the same principles but

01:54.620 --> 02:04.010
at the end of the day all we're doing is creating these models or functions by giving them inputs and

02:04.130 --> 02:11.630
some of our outputs to see how good we can create that function and all we're doing is moving ourselves

02:11.750 --> 02:20.330
away from the function writers to simply the data aggregators and the people that change the inputs

02:20.630 --> 02:25.260
here and there to try and make the function as good as possible.

02:25.300 --> 02:29.190
Now the topic of machine learning is really really vast.

02:29.320 --> 02:36.450
There's different topics that we can explore but the key thing is that there are a lot of tools and

02:36.460 --> 02:43.450
in order for you to do machine learning really well you need big datasets.

02:43.450 --> 02:49.720
So companies that we talked about like Microsoft Amazon Netflix can do machine learning really well

02:50.020 --> 02:56.490
and invest a lot of money into machine learning because they have these datasets available now.

02:56.500 --> 03:04.660
You can create your custom models but these big companies also offer things like trainable models that

03:04.660 --> 03:12.790
is very general models like vision auto email vision that you can train but they initially at least

03:13.030 --> 03:20.080
have created the base model for you or you can even use the pre trained models which essentially do

03:20.110 --> 03:21.550
everything for you.

03:21.580 --> 03:27.550
It's that model that you can just plug and play and use and you get the benefit of all that data that

03:27.550 --> 03:28.720
Google collected.

03:28.720 --> 03:32.110
They just give you the model that you want to use.

03:32.200 --> 03:38.770
You want to do translation Well you just send them the text and they'll respond with the translated

03:38.800 --> 03:41.900
text for you because remember what I said.

03:42.010 --> 03:49.630
The value is not necessarily in the model but in the data that we use in creating that model.

03:49.630 --> 03:50.950
This was a big topic.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.570
I hope your head doesn't hurt.

03:52.690 --> 03:56.080
And if you don't get everything 100 percent don't worry.

03:56.080 --> 04:02.110
This is a big topic that is constantly evolving and there are so many advances happening every single

04:02.110 --> 04:09.640
day that even the experts are overwhelmed the idea of this section was just to introduce you to the

04:09.640 --> 04:14.690
topic so that maybe if this picture interest you can explore these topics on your own.

04:14.770 --> 04:21.130
Further along I'll least some resources some of my favorite resources for you so that you can explore

04:21.130 --> 04:22.480
this a little bit further.

04:22.480 --> 04:23.270
But for now.

04:23.470 --> 04:24.820
Good job getting this far.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.080
I'm really proud of you.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.970
I'll see you in the next one.

04:27.970 --> 04:28.270
Bye bye.
