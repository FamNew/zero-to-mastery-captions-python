00:00.570 --> 00:02.810
Let's say that we've created our model now.

00:02.850 --> 00:12.510
We have our K and N dot predict function that we can now run whenever we want to perhaps use let's say

00:12.510 --> 00:17.960
a user inputs a whole new photo that we haven't seen before of an iris flower.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.370
And we want to predict what that flower type is.

00:21.540 --> 00:22.350
How can we do that.

00:23.250 --> 00:25.200
Well let's create a new variable here.

00:25.200 --> 00:31.590
Let's say a sample equals and create our own sample data.

00:31.590 --> 00:35.120
If we go to our data over here

00:38.150 --> 00:45.480
we see that the data set over here has 1 2 3 4 parameters.

00:45.540 --> 00:48.620
So this is an array that contains 5.1.

00:48.720 --> 00:55.420
Three point five one point four and zero point two so let's just enter some numbers here.

00:55.510 --> 01:06.550
Let's say that here we have three then five then four then two and then the second image has a parameter

01:06.550 --> 01:11.380
of 2 and 3 and 5 and 4.

01:11.410 --> 01:22.570
So that's our sample data we can now give our can then predict function which is our model.

01:22.710 --> 01:33.150
These sample data so let's say that's going to equal the predictions variable and let's just do something

01:33.150 --> 01:37.030
neat with some list comprehension here.

01:37.110 --> 01:54.020
We'll say that they predict species is going to equal the iris dot target names p for p which is a variable

01:54.020 --> 02:04.190
that we create in the predictions so I'm just using a little nice shorthand Python syntax to hopefully

02:04.460 --> 02:06.780
give us the prediction answers.

02:06.800 --> 02:19.810
So let's say print and then our predictions is going to be the predict species so that if I run this

02:21.470 --> 02:23.440
whoops What a mess up here.

02:23.490 --> 02:26.830
Targa names not Tiger names target names.

02:27.180 --> 02:29.800
Let's run that again.

02:29.800 --> 02:30.580
There you go.

02:30.580 --> 02:32.390
These are my predictions.

02:32.410 --> 02:39.060
So the first one is versus color and the second one was predicted to be Virginia.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.990
Well it's hard to say if it's right or wrong.

02:42.050 --> 02:42.640
Right.

02:42.650 --> 02:47.330
That's why we have a test dataset so that we know the answer to these questions.

02:47.390 --> 02:53.900
Ideally we have a human labeled these so that we can test and see if this was right or wrong.

02:53.900 --> 02:58.490
Right now we don't know if it's right or wrong but at least we know that it's making predictions and

02:58.490 --> 03:06.290
it's making predictions at a ninety six percent accuracy based on our white test data.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.850
Very very cool.
