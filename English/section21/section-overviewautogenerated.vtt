00:00.540 --> 00:00.960
Oh boy.

00:00.960 --> 00:05.880
Here it is the coolest sounding section in the entire course.

00:05.880 --> 00:13.470
Machine learning now throughout the course we've learned that machines are really really good at certain

00:13.470 --> 00:14.520
things.

00:14.520 --> 00:21.480
Machines can perform tasks really really fast and we learn through Python that we can control these

00:21.480 --> 00:24.980
machines and get them to do tasks for us.

00:25.050 --> 00:30.920
Now these machines or computers are really good at things that we can describe right that we can write

00:30.930 --> 00:34.890
in code if else blocks to do something.

00:34.890 --> 00:42.300
Computers are really good at working on tasks that have these defined rules all the way up to a game

00:42.300 --> 00:43.720
of chess right.

00:43.860 --> 00:51.540
When you play a game of chess against a computer we could technically have if else blocks lots of them

00:51.780 --> 00:56.260
to see how to move each piece and what the pros and cons are.

00:56.430 --> 01:03.050
But then as soon as we stop having these specific rules things start to break down.

01:03.090 --> 01:05.130
For example what is a cat.

01:05.670 --> 01:10.950
If you could describe that to a computer or you had to program in Python and tried to write that code

01:10.950 --> 01:19.210
in Python would you be able to I mean sure you can say hey a cat has fur a cat has whiskers.

01:19.220 --> 01:24.290
Cat meows but then the computer asks you back what is a meal.

01:24.290 --> 01:33.520
What is for the harder things become to describe the harder it is for us to tell machines what to do

01:34.570 --> 01:39.910
in this section we're going to tackle this problem and we tackle this problem using something called

01:39.910 --> 01:41.470
machine learning.

01:41.470 --> 01:48.250
And you've definitely heard of it because it is a big buzzword right now in our industry because with

01:48.250 --> 01:56.090
machine learning you have so many applications we could have self-driving cars robots vision processing

01:56.110 --> 02:03.120
language processing recommendation engines translations stock price predictions.

02:03.280 --> 02:05.140
There's so many applications.

02:05.140 --> 02:13.060
The goal of machine learning is to make machines act more and more like humans because the smarter they

02:13.060 --> 02:20.990
get the more they help us humans accomplish our goals now in this section we're going to go over some

02:20.990 --> 02:27.620
theory to get us familiar with this topic and then do three projects on both data science and machine

02:27.620 --> 02:31.590
learning to understand this topic a little bit more.

02:31.670 --> 02:32.390
Don't worry.

02:32.390 --> 02:33.830
Don't get intimidated.

02:33.830 --> 02:37.460
We're going to try and simplify things and have fun along the way.

02:37.460 --> 02:38.150
Let's get started.
