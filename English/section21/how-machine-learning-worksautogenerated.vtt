00:00.830 --> 00:01.590
All right.

00:01.610 --> 00:03.170
I know what you're thinking.

00:03.320 --> 00:04.530
You're thinking Andre.

00:04.610 --> 00:06.380
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:06.380 --> 00:13.220
What is machine learning you haven't really told me anything I have nothing to apply to.

00:13.220 --> 00:20.690
Well let's go back to this topic of machines and computers and the fact that they don't really understand

00:20.780 --> 00:21.480
words.

00:21.560 --> 00:22.300
Right.

00:22.310 --> 00:26.450
If I ask my computer hey is this a snake.

00:26.450 --> 00:28.370
Is this a python.

00:28.400 --> 00:29.710
My computer is going to.

00:29.840 --> 00:38.060
Well I have no idea what I'm talking about when I look at an image of a snake no matter what color it

00:38.060 --> 00:45.470
is no matter whether it's a cartoon or real life image or whether it has different directions with different

00:45.470 --> 00:46.340
animals in it.

00:46.430 --> 00:57.760
I can identify a snake right away our brains just know but to tell my computer what a snake is is almost

00:57.880 --> 00:59.540
impossible right.

00:59.620 --> 01:02.220
Because there's so many factors.

01:02.320 --> 01:11.800
A snake doesn't have legs and arms but an airplane doesn't have legs and arms a snake has scales.

01:11.800 --> 01:19.080
But then the computer is going to ask me what are scales but with machine learning we can actually teach

01:19.440 --> 01:27.270
a computer to know what a snake is or at least pretended like it knows.

01:27.270 --> 01:29.790
So how do we do this.

01:29.800 --> 01:38.480
Well you remember this diagram I hope it's simply what we do in programming that is we give an input

01:38.570 --> 01:47.020
let's say a list of one two three we give it to a function and there's an output of 2 4 6.

01:47.030 --> 01:52.560
So clearly this function multiplies our list items in our list by 2.

01:52.730 --> 01:57.900
And often our programs are procedural.

01:58.160 --> 02:05.600
That is we have if this then that do this then this type of conditions we tell the computer what to

02:05.600 --> 02:16.510
do we write as programmers the input and the function and all the computer does is actually just calculate

02:16.570 --> 02:19.170
using the input and the function the output.

02:19.480 --> 02:25.900
And it can do that really really fast for us instead of having a human do something when let's say a

02:25.900 --> 02:31.170
list is millions of items long machine learning changes.

02:31.170 --> 02:43.330
This idea it says hey give me the input and give me what you want the output to be that is give me all

02:43.330 --> 02:45.100
the data that you have.

02:45.100 --> 02:48.010
And by the way tell me what the answer is.

02:48.070 --> 02:50.470
Or at least what the output that you want.

02:50.470 --> 02:58.690
So in this case I want the input to be a list of 1 2 and 3 and the output to be a list of 2 4 and 6

03:00.400 --> 03:10.060
and then the interesting part is that as developers we give this input and output but with machine learning

03:10.120 --> 03:15.240
we say hey machine you figure out what this function is.

03:15.670 --> 03:25.390
Because if I give you let's say instead of a list A list of all these snake pictures or maybe animals

03:25.600 --> 03:29.620
and I want you to tell me if this image has a snake or not.

03:29.620 --> 03:33.810
Or maybe these 100 images which one of them have snakes.

03:33.850 --> 03:37.610
Well I don't know how to tell you how to do that.

03:37.630 --> 03:41.180
So instead you figure it out yourself.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.490
Here are all the pictures.

03:43.600 --> 03:52.460
And here is what I expect the output to be either snake or not snake and with machine learning the function

03:52.610 --> 03:56.960
is generated or created by the machine.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.410
Sounds really cool doesn't it.

03:59.450 --> 04:05.640
And this is machine learning it's simply a function.

04:05.750 --> 04:12.410
So instead of us writing the function like we have before with machine learning the machine writes the

04:12.410 --> 04:19.490
function we just give it the input and the output and the word function can be replaced with a model.

04:19.490 --> 04:22.280
You might have heard of the word machine learning model.

04:22.370 --> 04:24.040
That's all a model is.

04:24.050 --> 04:32.340
It's a function that receives an input and returns an output another word might be algorithm a machine

04:32.430 --> 04:38.970
learning algorithm a machine learning bought and at the end of the day it's a brain we're pretending

04:39.150 --> 04:46.930
that this machine is a brain that understands the inputs and gives us the desired output.

04:46.930 --> 04:53.680
Now the interesting side effect of this is that often when we talk about machine learning models these

04:53.770 --> 05:01.210
functions are really hard to understand because the computer comes up with this function as a human.

05:01.300 --> 05:04.310
It's hard to really understand how it works.

05:04.420 --> 05:11.320
And as these models get more and more complex it becomes harder and harder for us as developers to understand

05:11.350 --> 05:12.390
how it works.

05:12.610 --> 05:19.030
Which raises a lot of issues but we don't need to get into that now as you can see the main part of

05:19.030 --> 05:27.910
this is that in order to train this machine to create this function we have to give it data and for

05:27.910 --> 05:29.200
it to be really really good.

05:29.290 --> 05:36.660
We have to give it lots and lots of data and then we want to test to make sure that this data that we

05:36.660 --> 05:39.130
give in gives us the correct output.

05:39.970 --> 05:47.020
So at the end of the day machine learning is simply a computer writing its own function based on the

05:47.020 --> 05:49.150
inputs and outputs.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.880
That's pretty cool isn't it.

05:50.890 --> 05:52.500
I'll see you in the next video.

05:52.670 --> 05:52.900
Bye.
