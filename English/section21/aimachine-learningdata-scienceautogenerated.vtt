00:00.650 --> 00:06.350
Now up to this point in the course we've talked about Python careers and we've talked about being a

00:06.350 --> 00:13.940
back end developer using Python about testing and automation about being a general python developer

00:13.940 --> 00:20.060
and doing scripting being a software engineer and just writing software using python.

00:20.060 --> 00:25.580
But we haven't really touched on the subject of machine learning or research analyst data scientist

00:25.790 --> 00:32.920
data analyst and you see all these fields kind of overlap.

00:33.130 --> 00:38.430
So what is machine learning when we talk about machine learning.

00:38.510 --> 00:41.450
You have to keep this diagram in mind.

00:41.450 --> 00:50.360
You see it all starts with A.I. or artificial intelligence which simply means a human intelligence exhibited

00:50.450 --> 00:58.670
by machines an A.I. is while a machine that acts like a human and currently in our industry we have

00:58.670 --> 01:06.680
something called Narrow A.I. that is machines can be just as good or even better than humans at a specific

01:06.680 --> 01:07.980
task.

01:08.060 --> 01:16.460
For example detecting heart disease from images or at the game of Go or even video games.

01:16.820 --> 01:23.780
But narrow A.I. that we have currently simply means those machines can only do one thing really well

01:23.960 --> 01:28.400
they can't be like humans and have multiple abilities.

01:28.400 --> 01:34.350
That's called General A.I. and it's something that we're very very far away from now.

01:34.350 --> 01:43.200
Machine learning is a subset of A.I. and machine learning is an approach to try and achieve artificial

01:43.200 --> 01:49.470
intelligence through systems that can find patterns in a set of data.

01:49.470 --> 01:56.220
And actually Stanford University describes machine learning as the science of getting computers to act

01:56.310 --> 02:03.540
without being explicitly programmed that is getting machines to do things without us specifically saying

02:03.780 --> 02:07.710
do this then do that then do this and don't worry.

02:07.750 --> 02:10.720
We'll explore that more throughout the section.

02:10.720 --> 02:18.370
Now you may have also heard of deep learning and deep learning or deep neural networks is just one of

02:18.370 --> 02:22.360
the techniques for implementing machine learning.

02:22.370 --> 02:26.330
For now you can just think of it as a type of algorithm.

02:27.140 --> 02:35.240
But then we have this thing of data science and often the role of a data science and a machine learning

02:35.240 --> 02:43.310
expert are quite overlapping and most job descriptions actually don't even have a clear distinction

02:43.340 --> 02:48.430
between what is a machine learning expert and a data science expert.

02:48.710 --> 02:55.340
The field of data science simply means analyzing data looking at data and then doing something with

02:55.340 --> 02:58.580
it usually some sort of a business goal.

02:58.610 --> 03:03.170
So when we talk about machine learning there's a lot of overlap with data science.

03:03.560 --> 03:08.810
So throughout the next couple of videos we're going to be talking about both of these topics because

03:08.810 --> 03:15.200
both of them relate and overlap and he can't do one without the other because you need to be able to

03:15.200 --> 03:20.040
understand data and work with data to do any of these things.

03:21.230 --> 03:27.620
And that's why when we talk about careers often things like machine learning data scientist data analyst

03:27.650 --> 03:35.150
or research analyst are similar because they all work with data and from that data they want to derive

03:35.150 --> 03:41.260
some sort of an action for the business for the company or for the person.

03:41.270 --> 03:42.560
All right that's enough for now.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.090
Let's move on to the next video.
