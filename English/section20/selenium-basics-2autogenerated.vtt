WEBVTT

00:00.380 --> 00:00.800
All right.

00:00.870 --> 00:05.860
It's time to do something useful with our selenium driver.

00:05.870 --> 00:09.890
We want to try and grab this input.

00:09.890 --> 00:10.810
Put some text in it.

00:10.850 --> 00:12.670
Then click on Show message.

00:12.710 --> 00:17.900
Just like you we would on our Web site maybe where we're trying to sign in automatically to test the

00:17.960 --> 00:23.810
sign in functionality or to test some sort of a form functionality in our app.

00:23.810 --> 00:25.560
How can we do this.

00:25.580 --> 00:27.610
Well let me clear this first.

00:27.650 --> 00:32.650
Just so we have a clean palette and start with a few things.

00:32.690 --> 00:37.310
The first thing I like to do when working with selenium is to make sure that as we progressed through

00:37.310 --> 00:41.740
the code we're doing things correctly by using these assert commands.

00:42.080 --> 00:48.980
So I can say assert and we want to assert that this button text which we're going to use which is show

00:48.980 --> 00:58.430
message we want to assert that this show message actually exists on our page.

00:58.430 --> 01:06.530
Now an easy way to check this is to say Chrome browser and instead of tidal we want to just check the

01:06.530 --> 01:07.040
page

01:11.920 --> 01:20.160
and page source is simply if I right click here and look at the view page source is simply the HMO version

01:20.160 --> 01:30.750
of the entire Web site that we see which should have the show Message button so by doing this hopefully

01:30.810 --> 01:38.070
if everything works up until like 12:00 we should just get true without any errors.

01:38.070 --> 01:42.140
So let's run that.

01:42.170 --> 01:42.560
All right.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.580
We don't get any errors.

01:43.580 --> 01:45.080
Everything is good.

01:45.080 --> 01:46.390
Now let's move on.

01:46.490 --> 01:51.230
The first thing I want to do is grab this input so I'm going to inspect

01:55.570 --> 01:56.370
where let's close this.

01:56.360 --> 02:04.540
So we have a better view of this and use inspect on the input.

02:04.590 --> 02:10.420
We see that the input over here has it has an I.D. of user message.

02:10.470 --> 02:15.690
So we can grab this with I.D. If you remember and we scroll up to our cheat sheet here

02:18.660 --> 02:23.930
we see that we can grab elements by I.D. using defined element by I.D. method.

02:23.970 --> 02:25.350
So let's do that.

02:25.350 --> 02:37.180
I'm going to say Chrome browser dot find element by I.D. and the I.D. name that I wanted to grab was

02:37.180 --> 02:38.970
the user message.

02:39.100 --> 02:39.950
So let's do that.

02:39.970 --> 02:47.980
I'm going to say user message and the first thing I want to do now that we've grabbed this I.D. is I

02:47.980 --> 02:56.790
want to make sure that there's no text in here maybe from a previous user so usually when grabbing inputs

02:57.120 --> 03:06.000
I'll do something like user message let's create a new variable here called User message and I'm going

03:06.000 --> 03:14.430
to say a user message dot clear to clear wherever is in the input and then from there and let's make

03:14.430 --> 03:16.680
sure this is underscore like this

03:21.260 --> 03:31.950
and then from here we can use the send Quis and send Keys says hey in the user message sent these keystrokes

03:32.010 --> 03:42.260
as if a user is typing and give it the string let's do I am extra cool that's kind of silly but that

03:42.260 --> 03:42.980
should be fine.

03:43.010 --> 03:45.040
So we're going to mimic typing.

03:45.030 --> 03:52.430
I am extra cool into that input after we've cleared it so let's see if this works.

03:52.470 --> 03:59.700
I'm going to run.

03:59.890 --> 04:00.570
Whoa.

04:00.580 --> 04:01.540
How cool is that.

04:01.540 --> 04:02.280
Do you see that.

04:02.470 --> 04:06.880
We just automated typing into a box and it says I am extra cool.

04:07.630 --> 04:09.380
Awesome.

04:09.390 --> 04:17.340
Now the next step is we want to grab this button and then simulate a click on it so that your message

04:17.370 --> 04:18.950
gets displayed on here.

04:19.980 --> 04:23.110
If I click show message you see that I get this printed.

04:23.700 --> 04:29.220
Let's close some of our browsers because I feel like we have a ton of selenium browsers open right now

04:31.290 --> 04:32.240
that's better.

04:33.070 --> 04:39.080
So now that we have this once again we can select the button.

04:39.340 --> 04:47.280
So remember we can select a button just like this but well let's not call a button text and I like being

04:47.280 --> 04:50.400
specific here so let's call this show.

04:50.520 --> 04:53.150
Message button.

04:53.350 --> 05:03.060
Now this show Message button which we've grabbed before the first thing we want to do is to well simulate

05:03.180 --> 05:06.100
a click just like that.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.780
So we sent keys and then we click.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.210
So let's see if that works.

05:10.330 --> 05:13.030
I'm going to say this and run

05:20.390 --> 05:22.110
it looks like that didn't work.

05:22.110 --> 05:23.880
Let me check what happened.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.960
We get a name error button Texas is not defined.

05:27.300 --> 05:32.820
And that's because we did not fix the naming in here in the print function.

05:32.820 --> 05:39.530
So let's just change the name here we can actually just comment this out because we don't need it printed

05:39.530 --> 05:40.460
anymore.

05:40.460 --> 05:41.690
And let's run it again

05:47.000 --> 05:47.570
word.

05:47.580 --> 05:50.830
You see that also did you notice how fast that happened.

05:50.910 --> 05:51.990
I am extra cool.

05:52.050 --> 05:57.160
He got clicks your message and now my message appears very very cool.

05:57.180 --> 06:01.840
Let's say that we wanted to grab this information.

06:01.930 --> 06:02.560
What can we do.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.230
Well once again we can right click.

06:05.230 --> 06:13.010
So let's use our default let's right click inspect and you can guess by now that this is starting to

06:13.010 --> 06:13.460
get easy.

06:13.460 --> 06:16.360
We see that we have the I.D. of display.

06:16.400 --> 06:26.100
So we're going to grab that and say this is going to be the output message and the output message will

06:26.100 --> 06:38.880
be the Chrome browser dot find element by I.D. and give it the display and maybe now to verify that

06:38.880 --> 06:40.170
this is working.

06:40.170 --> 06:51.230
I'm going to do an ASR method and say hey I want to assert that the I am extra cool.

06:51.230 --> 06:58.400
How many o's OSes that for us looks right is in the output message.

06:58.620 --> 07:06.930
And while we want to do is to actually see the text so we can actually say the inner HMO like we've

07:06.930 --> 07:13.120
done here with get attribute or we can just say text so if I run this

07:21.540 --> 07:24.380
no airs everything is working.

07:24.540 --> 07:31.100
Now this is a simple example but did you notice how fast everything happened.

07:31.200 --> 07:37.080
I mean if a human was to do this you'd have to select here and type this and then you have to click

07:37.080 --> 07:40.690
show message and then your message finally gets to this point.

07:40.710 --> 07:48.390
The reason testing automation is such an important part of software development is that you can do things

07:48.390 --> 07:49.720
really really fast.

07:49.770 --> 07:55.730
You let the machine control the browser extremely fast so you can test as many times as you want.

07:55.800 --> 08:03.920
Millions of times you can similarly clicks you can enter information just anything that a human to do

08:04.280 --> 08:09.860
selenium lets you use as well now want to show you one other way to select.

08:09.860 --> 08:12.010
That is very very common.

08:12.020 --> 08:18.770
We've seen that we can do find element by I.D. find element by class name but another very useful one

08:19.370 --> 08:29.430
is something called Chrome browser dot find element instead of class name we use something called CSX

08:32.960 --> 08:34.480
and CSX selector.

08:34.550 --> 08:43.620
We're not going to learn CSX here but CSX in a browser is the styling that you get.

08:43.620 --> 08:53.580
So for example if I was to look at the button and I do inspect you see that the class has button button

08:53.580 --> 08:59.520
default and in a class this is what we call CSX.

08:59.520 --> 09:02.590
This tells it hey these are the styles that we want.

09:02.610 --> 09:08.340
You can see over here in the styles tab that we have button default and button and this controls our

09:08.340 --> 09:09.670
styles on a web page.

09:09.720 --> 09:17.330
For example if I uncheck this my button well now has no styling.

09:17.330 --> 09:19.290
If I uncheck some of this as well.

09:19.310 --> 09:28.160
Again the button styling goes away so we're actually able to use CSX selectors again something that

09:28.160 --> 09:33.290
you can Google on your own or I teach my other courses to actually grab this.

09:33.290 --> 09:35.500
So the way we would do something like this and grab.

09:35.510 --> 09:46.570
Button button default is to use the let's say CSX class dot button and this is a CSX selector.

09:46.590 --> 09:52.800
For example if I wanted to grab all buttons that are under the form get input which is I.D. get input

09:53.130 --> 09:59.070
then I would do pound which stands for I.D. get input

10:03.020 --> 10:09.270
and then say all forms that have the I.D. get input and anything that is a child button.

10:09.320 --> 10:22.470
I want you to grab so that if I do user message or user button I'll say two here if I print this out

10:22.470 --> 10:35.770
now and say a user born to this should have been selected not select let's fix that.

10:35.980 --> 10:40.310
You see that I'm able to grab this element that way as well.

10:40.320 --> 10:40.830
All right.

10:40.830 --> 10:44.460
Let's take a break because check out all the windows that I just opened up.

10:44.460 --> 10:49.600
This is getting a little insane so in the next video I'm going to show you how to close all of these.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.250
I'll see in the next one about.
