Let's talk about a possible career path when you know python.

00:05.560 --> 00:09.070
And one is testing and automation.

00:09.340 --> 00:11.290
Now what is that.

00:11.410 --> 00:14.600
Why would we use this well.

00:14.600 --> 00:21.560
Think about it if let's say you had a company that was working on an app you want to make sure that

00:21.560 --> 00:29.850
this app works properly and what a lot of companies do is hire people who can help with testing.

00:29.850 --> 00:36.180
Now we have a section on testing with python in this course where we write to unit test through code

00:37.240 --> 00:45.040
but usually when people work with applications we're human users we perhaps touch the screen.

00:45.040 --> 00:51.440
If the app is on an iPad perhaps we scroll through and submit a form.

00:51.660 --> 00:59.280
We need to test and automate these steps to make sure our applications work and companies hire Python

00:59.280 --> 01:02.460
developers in order to help with automation.

01:02.460 --> 01:08.820
You see through programming we can actually interact with something like a browser or an app and mimic

01:08.850 --> 01:13.970
human actions to make sure that the application works as expected.

01:13.980 --> 01:16.350
Now this isn't just for phone apps.

01:16.350 --> 01:19.440
This works all across software.

01:19.440 --> 01:24.870
If you're working with software you want to make sure that it works properly and instead of hiring thousands

01:24.870 --> 01:26.350
of people to test your app.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.100
I mean you could totally do that.

01:28.110 --> 01:34.290
You can also through code mimic thousands millions of users playing through your app and testing out

01:34.290 --> 01:35.130
your application.

01:35.910 --> 01:42.870
So in the next couple of videos I'm going to show you how a testing automation person might work with

01:42.870 --> 01:44.040
Python.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.920
It's gonna be a fun one through code.

01:45.930 --> 01:48.490
We're going to perform actions on the browser.

01:48.570 --> 01:49.170
Let's get started.
