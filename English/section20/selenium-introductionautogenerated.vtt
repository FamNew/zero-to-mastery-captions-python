WEBVTT

00:00.670 --> 00:09.190
Now one of the best tools for browser automation is selenium and selenium works not just with Python

00:09.220 --> 00:11.610
but with lots of programming languages.

00:11.680 --> 00:20.140
But what it gives us is the ability to browse or use a browser without a human involved just through

00:20.140 --> 00:20.530
code.

00:20.530 --> 00:27.760
We can act and move around the mouse click on buttons and interact with the Web site and in this section

00:27.820 --> 00:32.660
we're gonna be using selenium now in order to install selenium.

00:33.110 --> 00:38.320
As you can see we'll have to use pip install now at the bottom here you see that.

00:38.350 --> 00:44.570
It says you may consider using virtual app to create isolated Python environments.

00:44.570 --> 00:47.320
Now we already know about this right.

00:47.330 --> 00:55.130
You could install pip install like this and have it available across your entire machine or you can

00:55.130 --> 01:01.100
use something like pip and to install it just for your specific project or you can use pi charm and

01:01.100 --> 01:04.250
use their automatic virtual environments.

01:04.260 --> 01:10.320
Now we've covered those topics in the other videos so I won't hear in my case I'm just going to install

01:10.320 --> 01:12.840
it globally like this.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.560
So I'm going to get started first.

01:15.750 --> 01:28.100
We're going to install selenium someone say pip in my case Pip 3 install selenium.

01:28.190 --> 01:34.160
Now once you have selenium installed you can create a file in my case I have an automation duck py file

01:34.220 --> 01:34.720
here.

01:34.760 --> 01:38.360
Let's make this a little bit bigger and this little bit bigger.

01:38.530 --> 01:40.680
Let me clear this now.

01:40.680 --> 01:50.020
The next step is to well import in our file so I can say import or actually from selenium package that

01:50.020 --> 01:51.430
we just installed.

01:51.730 --> 01:55.370
We can say import web driver.

01:55.600 --> 02:03.130
Now web driver is going to allow us to drive the Web through code however in order for us to be able

02:03.130 --> 02:05.680
to use selenium properly.

02:05.680 --> 02:14.390
If you go to the installation page here you see that there's something called drivers you see selenium

02:14.450 --> 02:24.080
works with these drivers because each browser like Chrome edge Firefox and Safari has different drivers

02:24.920 --> 02:27.920
to interface with the different browsers.

02:27.980 --> 02:34.310
So based on what browser you want to use to automate things you have to install each of these drivers

02:36.290 --> 02:38.780
in our case let's use the chrome driver.

02:38.840 --> 02:44.600
So we would just click over here and you can see over here that we have the different chrome drivers

02:44.690 --> 02:45.730
that we can use.

02:45.770 --> 02:47.050
You have the current releases.

02:47.060 --> 02:56.720
So the latest versions now usually the latest releases are now what we call stable that is maybe they're

02:56.720 --> 02:57.560
just brand new.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.300
So they haven't been tested enough.

02:59.300 --> 03:05.600
So what I'd like to do is to actually go to the Chrome driver tab here and make sure that we select

03:05.660 --> 03:08.250
the latest stable release.

03:08.270 --> 03:13.250
So based on when you watched this video this version number might be a little bit higher but as long

03:13.250 --> 03:20.120
as it's a stable release instead of the latest beta release which is chrome driver 76 then that's fine.

03:20.210 --> 03:26.540
So let's click over here and you'll see that as soon as I click here you'll give me zip files that I

03:26.540 --> 03:29.480
can install based on my machine.

03:29.480 --> 03:37.700
Now in my case I'm using a Mac so I'll just install the Mac driver and once they open up the zip file

03:39.140 --> 03:43.540
you'll see that I get this chrome driver executable.

03:43.760 --> 03:49.580
Now an executable is kind of like a dot e XY on a Windows machine.

03:49.580 --> 03:55.160
If I double click this it's going to run some code had some binary code that we can run on the machine.

03:55.370 --> 03:57.800
But this is our chrome driver.

03:57.800 --> 04:04.340
This is going to allow selenium to be able to open up our Chrome browser and manipulate that browser

04:05.420 --> 04:05.900
now.

04:05.990 --> 04:14.180
In my case I'm going to move this to my desktop because that's where my automation python file is.

04:14.180 --> 04:15.590
There we go.

04:15.590 --> 04:17.040
Now if I close this.

04:17.270 --> 04:25.070
And by the way if you go to Pipeline and click on selenium the package it will actually explain some

04:25.070 --> 04:27.110
of these installation steps as well.

04:27.110 --> 04:32.470
So you can actually run through this quick setup as well.

04:32.470 --> 04:40.570
Now in our case now that we have the chrome driver what we need to do is to now create an instance of

04:40.570 --> 04:51.110
the browser so let's just call this chrome browser and this is going to equal the web driver that we

04:51.110 --> 04:52.270
just imported.

04:53.150 --> 04:57.660
And then in here use Chrome as the browser.

04:57.860 --> 05:00.180
And then inside as the parameter.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.080
Remember this is the chrome class the web driver gives us.

05:03.080 --> 05:11.100
We have to give it the driver in order to drive the browser now because our chrome driver is in the

05:11.100 --> 05:13.560
same directory as in my file.

05:13.560 --> 05:22.640
I can just do a dot slash or use a string and say chrome driver which is the name of the driver.

05:24.500 --> 05:30.730
Now let's make this a little bit smaller so we can see everything now in here.

05:31.970 --> 05:38.750
If we had multiple projects we'd ideally use chrome driver not just copy and paste chrome driver everywhere

05:38.750 --> 05:44.570
into our project folders but instead you'd put it into your path.

05:44.570 --> 05:45.200
What does that mean.

05:45.710 --> 05:51.380
Well just like when we installed selenium when we did Pip 3 install selenium.

05:52.310 --> 05:59.750
Usually when you install something globally or when you have it available globally if you're on a Mac

06:00.080 --> 06:10.890
or Linux computer you usually will put it under user local then folder and you'd put it inside of this

06:10.890 --> 06:11.730
folder.

06:12.060 --> 06:18.660
If you're on a Windows you'd usually put it in its path in the windows folder of the C drive.

06:18.660 --> 06:25.500
And if you do that you can actually just keep this as blank and the driver will actually look for the

06:25.920 --> 06:28.140
Chrome driver in this path.

06:29.280 --> 06:35.900
But in our case we'll just leave it like this so make sure that the chrome driver is in the same folder

06:35.930 --> 06:38.580
as the file now in here.

06:38.650 --> 06:45.410
Let's print out what we have as a Chrome browser so I'm going to just run this file

06:51.150 --> 06:56.460
and I get an error during handling of the bag above exception where it looks like I get a file not found

06:56.460 --> 06:56.690
error.

06:56.700 --> 07:00.960
And that's because I made a little typo here it should be chrome driver.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.310
So let's say that again.

07:02.310 --> 07:06.320
Give that another go.

07:06.410 --> 07:11.050
And did you see that Chrome just opened up for me.

07:11.190 --> 07:20.170
So right now automatically by running Chrome browser I got an instance of the Chrome browser so let's

07:20.170 --> 07:21.230
see what we can do here.

07:21.960 --> 07:33.410
Let's say we change our browser to just be like this if I go here and do Chrome browser.

07:33.570 --> 07:40.570
Dot maximize the window and run this method.

07:40.570 --> 07:45.800
Let's run our file now when we run this.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.120
Nothing happened.

07:47.120 --> 07:51.560
And the reason is you see over here that we get an error and you might get this as well.

07:51.590 --> 07:58.880
It says not created exception message session not created this version of Chrome driver only supports

07:59.120 --> 08:01.440
chrome version seventy five.

08:01.460 --> 08:07.520
So you have to make sure that the driver that you install in our case it was the stable one is compatible

08:07.520 --> 08:09.530
with the version of Chrome that you have.

08:09.530 --> 08:17.880
Most likely you'll have to update your chrome version so you see over here that I have a version 74

08:19.010 --> 08:24.190
but in here says hey this is compatible only with Chrome version 75.

08:24.620 --> 08:26.410
So how can we fix this.

08:26.450 --> 08:28.190
We're simply going to relaunch

08:33.230 --> 08:39.590
I have updated my chrome version again if you're not sure how to do that you simply go to Chrome and

08:39.830 --> 08:45.140
go to about Google Chrome or preferences and you'll be able to update to the latest version or make

08:45.140 --> 08:51.270
sure that you're using the version that matches your driver now that we have version 75.

08:51.310 --> 08:54.340
Let's try this again.

08:54.380 --> 08:56.990
I'm going to run my file

09:01.310 --> 09:07.350
and look at that I get Chrome is being controlled by an automated test software.

09:07.790 --> 09:16.080
So I've just created a new window a new instance which is what we've done here with the Chrome browser

09:17.180 --> 09:20.400
and I've just said Maximize Window.

09:20.450 --> 09:29.930
Now if I remove Maximize Window here and I simply run this again you see that right now I have a narrow

09:29.940 --> 09:32.270
window this time with the window.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.500
Well now maximized just the default sizing.

09:35.640 --> 09:40.530
So every time I run this I create a new instance of the browser.

09:40.590 --> 09:43.560
Very very cool.

09:43.580 --> 09:52.250
Now let's close these for now and in the next video we're going to explore how we can use this to actually

09:52.610 --> 09:55.210
move through web pages.

09:55.250 --> 10:00.800
Now if you haven't gotten this far Take your time to make sure that the versions match that you're able

10:00.800 --> 10:08.270
to run a browser from your command line and in the next video we're going to do some really cool things.

10:08.480 --> 10:09.920
I'll see on that one by.
