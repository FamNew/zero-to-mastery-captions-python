Welcome back automation masters.

00:02.910 --> 00:09.090
Now up until this point we've ran this code quite a bit of times and you see that now I have a ton of

00:09.330 --> 00:11.130
chrome browsers open.

00:11.130 --> 00:11.670
That's not good.

00:11.670 --> 00:13.980
How do we close these things.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.140
Well quite easily actually.

00:16.230 --> 00:21.040
All we have to do is say Chrome browser dot close.

00:21.250 --> 00:26.550
Now this close method is going to close our browsers.

00:26.620 --> 00:32.890
However a lot of people sometimes have issues with this method because browsers are constantly being

00:32.920 --> 00:38.860
updated and sometimes selenium has some bugs where it doesn't close this properly.

00:38.860 --> 00:41.720
So this may work for you now.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.310
In my case if I run this

00:48.180 --> 00:50.110
all right well that actually worked.

00:50.210 --> 00:53.140
But there are instances where this won't work.

00:53.150 --> 01:00.130
So you might have to actually call this twice to make sure that it closes the instance.

01:00.380 --> 01:06.860
Now using close is going to close the current window that it's open which is what we're doing here with

01:06.860 --> 01:07.740
quit.

01:07.760 --> 01:12.050
You actually get to close the entire chrome driver.

01:12.050 --> 01:22.040
So let's do quit now and see if this works.

01:22.110 --> 01:22.590
All right.

01:22.620 --> 01:25.690
So that also quit the browser.

01:25.770 --> 01:32.040
But if in your code for some reason you're opening up the browser twice it's going to quit all sessions

01:33.650 --> 01:37.970
unfortunately because these ones are all past instances.

01:38.210 --> 01:40.360
It's not going to know how to quit them.

01:40.370 --> 01:40.960
We should have.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.110
Well quit them from before.

01:42.110 --> 01:46.580
So you're going to have to manually closings for now but at least now you know that you just add this

01:46.580 --> 01:47.160
at the end.

01:47.180 --> 01:49.560
Sorry for showing you how to do that at the very end.

01:50.150 --> 01:56.060
But I had to keep it open so I can explain all these things that are happening to you but ideally you

01:56.090 --> 01:59.280
quit the browser afterwards.

01:59.290 --> 02:05.560
Now this quit and close actually causes a lot of headaches and sometimes it may not work on a browser.

02:05.620 --> 02:08.340
This depends on the versions that you have installed.

02:08.360 --> 02:13.780
There's a ton of forms online they can look up and say hey why isn't my browser quitting.

02:13.780 --> 02:20.890
So it's a it's a heavily debated thing that you can find information online on if it doesn't work for

02:20.890 --> 02:21.090
you.

02:21.090 --> 02:27.400
You might have to call this twice or you might have to check that the version you're using is working

02:27.400 --> 02:29.140
properly.

02:29.160 --> 02:34.920
Now some of you might be asking this gives you a lot of power right.

02:35.190 --> 02:41.790
Because I mean I can start writing bots to go through Web sites maybe I want to write a little board

02:41.790 --> 02:50.010
that goes on every single Reddit post and upvotes it or maybe I click like on a Facebook page over and

02:50.010 --> 02:59.880
over and over maybe there's a voting contest going on and I can just write scripts to automate people

02:59.880 --> 03:03.360
signing in random people signing in and uploading.

03:03.510 --> 03:05.130
Let's say your submission.

03:05.130 --> 03:10.710
So there's many good ways to use automation and many bad ways to use automation.

03:10.710 --> 03:19.080
Maybe you want to send personal messages to your Facebook friends while you can automate it and message

03:19.530 --> 03:26.840
thousands of them all at the same time using something like many but you see websites are smarter than

03:26.840 --> 03:37.350
that because most Web sites will detect when it's a robot controlling it versus when there is a human.

03:37.490 --> 03:39.740
Because of how fast things are happening.

03:39.740 --> 03:45.000
No human is going to be able to send keys and click that fast.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.050
Right.

03:46.100 --> 03:54.550
So selenium actually has thought of that if we actually go back here to the site that I originally showed

03:54.550 --> 04:04.440
you which I'll link to if you scroll all the way down to wait wait allows us to actually wait and simulate

04:04.440 --> 04:12.690
actions at a bit of a delay so most people that write automation scripts on Web sites will use something

04:12.690 --> 04:21.830
like sleep or wait to make sure that there's pauses in between actions so that while Web sites aren't

04:21.840 --> 04:29.890
going to say hey hey this is this is definitely not a human I'm going to block their usage for example

04:29.980 --> 04:36.220
here on the Udemy Web site I tried to write a script that did things really really fast and you'll see

04:36.220 --> 04:41.210
that Udemy actually blocks my activity and says hey please verify that you're a human.

04:41.530 --> 04:47.230
So that it says hey I'm detecting something that makes me believe that this isn't a human I don't want

04:47.230 --> 04:53.470
our servers to get logged with all this activity because I mean companies like you damn you have to

04:53.470 --> 04:58.930
pay for let's say interactions on the Web site because they're talking to back and servers.

04:58.930 --> 05:06.080
So you'll notice some of these things and you want to be careful with automation that you're usually

05:06.080 --> 05:12.440
testing on your own product or your company's product and that you're not abusing the other Web sites

05:12.470 --> 05:20.090
and trying to let's say a game the system but using something like weight actually allows you to at

05:20.090 --> 05:26.890
least not do things as fast as possible so you don't get detected as easily as possible with great power

05:26.890 --> 05:34.660
comes great responsibility and selenium is a great tool for testing a lot of companies hire testers

05:34.660 --> 05:37.940
and automation testers for this specific reason.

05:38.060 --> 05:41.470
It's a great career option for you.

05:41.470 --> 05:44.260
However you can also do bad things with this.

05:44.530 --> 05:46.450
So be responsible.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.380
Don't do anything that might get you in trouble.

05:49.540 --> 05:56.350
Not advocating for anything of that but I hope this gave you a little test into what automation testers

05:56.440 --> 06:03.910
do and you can use selenium not just on browsers you can use them pretty much on any screen you can

06:03.910 --> 06:09.260
run them on Android devices IOW devices pretty much any screen.

06:09.340 --> 06:12.540
I hope that was fun and I'll see you in another video Bye.
