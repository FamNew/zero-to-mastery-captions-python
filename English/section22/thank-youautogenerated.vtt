00:00.910 --> 00:02.030
I can't believe it.

00:02.050 --> 00:05.940
You're watching the final video in the course.

00:06.010 --> 00:07.120
You did it.

00:07.120 --> 00:10.030
You went through hours and hours of video.

00:10.060 --> 00:15.280
And trust me it was painful to make but I also understand that it wasn't easy.

00:16.160 --> 00:23.130
Most students that watched this course won't finish the course because it does take a lot of dedication.

00:23.240 --> 00:29.910
It does take a lot of hours and it does take a lot of practice to retain what you learn.

00:29.930 --> 00:33.780
So for getting this far I want to thank you.

00:33.850 --> 00:41.430
It really means a lot to me that you decided to spend your valuable time learning from me.

00:41.510 --> 00:49.910
It allows me to do what I do because of you so give yourself a pat on the back for getting this far

00:49.970 --> 00:56.280
for not quitting and hopefully for learning a little bit of Python.

00:56.330 --> 01:02.600
I hope you had fun and I hope I didn't make the course too boring for you and I hope at the end of it

01:02.600 --> 01:10.530
all you now feel comfortable with Python to do all sorts of things that we described in the course you

01:10.530 --> 01:11.880
definitely deserve a break.

01:11.880 --> 01:19.680
So thank you once again for being part of it all and I hope to see you in my other courses because while

01:20.190 --> 01:23.740
in the world of technology there's a lot to learn out there.

01:23.790 --> 01:27.180
So until next time I'll see in the next one.

01:27.180 --> 01:27.450
Bye bye.
