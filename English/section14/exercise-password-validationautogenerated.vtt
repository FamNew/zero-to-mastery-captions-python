00:00.650 --> 00:01.330
All right.

00:01.440 --> 00:02.950
Let's see how you did here.

00:02.970 --> 00:07.920
Now I could just google this and figure it out on my own.

00:07.920 --> 00:10.550
And I recommend that you do that as well.

00:10.590 --> 00:15.930
But for now just based on the fact that we only have two things let's try and write this from scratch

00:16.020 --> 00:17.940
again not something that I recommend.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.730
But hey this will be fun.

00:19.740 --> 00:20.400
Let's give it a go.

00:21.030 --> 00:22.740
So how would I search for this.

00:22.740 --> 00:25.610
Let's say I want to make sure that it's a password again.

00:25.740 --> 00:28.740
Eight characters long or more.

00:28.740 --> 00:36.490
But first I want to make sure that the password contains any sort of letters numbers and these symbols.

00:36.510 --> 00:37.020
You know what.

00:37.020 --> 00:39.210
Just for fun I'm going to add an extra challenge.

00:39.240 --> 00:43.970
I'm going to say it also has to end with a number.

00:43.980 --> 00:48.720
Now I know this is completely useless because you wouldn't want a password like that.

00:48.720 --> 00:49.890
That's way too restricting.

00:50.130 --> 00:51.410
But I think this would be fun.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.920
Now in here we want to check a password.

00:55.930 --> 00:58.770
Let's say it's super secret.

00:58.780 --> 01:04.080
It has some of those symbols that I mentioned and it has to end with a number.

01:04.090 --> 01:05.940
So we have to match all of this.

01:05.980 --> 01:08.930
And it's over a characters.

01:09.020 --> 01:16.880
The first thing I'm going to do is use our square brackets and say that we want to check for A to Z

01:18.420 --> 01:19.380
which we've seen before.

01:19.410 --> 01:22.560
If I scroll HERE WE HAVE A to Z.

01:22.620 --> 01:26.550
We also want to make sure it's lowercase as well also a tizzy as well.

01:26.550 --> 01:26.870
All right.

01:26.880 --> 01:34.540
We're matching some of the things you also want to make sure that you can use numbers zero to nine.

01:34.560 --> 01:34.820
All right.

01:34.830 --> 01:36.570
So we have some numbers in here.

01:36.600 --> 01:42.150
Let's say if I had some numbers that works as well and we also want to make sure that we can use some

01:42.150 --> 01:42.850
of the symbols.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.430
So let's just add the symbols that we can use.

01:45.450 --> 01:46.890
Let's go back to here.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.950
We can use this these symbols so let's just copy them.

01:51.290 --> 01:51.950
And paste them in.

01:52.890 --> 01:53.420
All right.

01:53.510 --> 01:59.840
Everything in here that matches is good and looks like yep we're matching things right now.

01:59.840 --> 02:00.350
That's good.

02:00.890 --> 02:05.050
But if I enter another letter here that's not going to work.

02:05.060 --> 02:06.940
We want to make sure that it ends with eight.

02:06.950 --> 02:11.840
We also want to make sure that it's going to be at least eight characters long because I could just

02:12.020 --> 02:14.710
do this and everything still works.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.040
So how can we do it.

02:16.610 --> 02:18.170
Well let's look at the reference here.

02:18.200 --> 02:23.990
If I scroll down let's see we have exactly three of a kind.

02:23.990 --> 02:25.000
Three or more.

02:25.030 --> 02:25.310
OK.

02:25.310 --> 02:32.430
This might be useful a three comma and these curly bracket matches at least three consecutive eight

02:32.430 --> 02:33.300
characters.

02:33.300 --> 02:33.470
All right.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.100
So it shows you exactly what it does.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.550
I think this is useful.

02:36.570 --> 02:43.960
So we want to make sure our password checker is at least eight characters long.

02:44.100 --> 02:50.940
So we're matching instead of a we're matching this whole string and it has to be at least eight characters

02:50.940 --> 02:51.530
long.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.410
So let's make it a character as long.

02:54.410 --> 02:55.160
And look at that.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.160
This is matching awesome.

02:58.210 --> 03:03.340
Now the next part is we want to make sure it ends with a number.

03:03.380 --> 03:05.180
So how can we do that again.

03:05.210 --> 03:07.910
Let's check out here if there's anything special let's do.

03:07.910 --> 03:12.350
Number or digits.

03:12.470 --> 03:12.830
All right.

03:12.830 --> 03:13.810
Look at that.

03:13.820 --> 03:18.270
Any digit so let's say any digit.

03:18.290 --> 03:23.330
So this slash D is going to match any decimal digit equivalent to zero.

03:23.330 --> 03:28.990
Tonight All right so if I do let's say slash D.

03:29.310 --> 03:29.550
All right.

03:29.550 --> 03:32.980
Everything is still matching but if I type anything else out here.

03:33.000 --> 03:33.260
Yep.

03:33.270 --> 03:36.070
Now it's fairly so.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.620
There's our password checker right here.

03:38.900 --> 03:51.780
So I can just go to code generator copy this go to my ripple and here let's just create a new one say

03:51.780 --> 04:01.840
password that will have the compiled pattern are and then paste this in.

04:01.850 --> 04:06.380
So this is gonna be our password and I'm going to check our password.

04:06.380 --> 04:12.640
Let's say B or let's just say check equals pattern or instead of pattern.

04:12.650 --> 04:18.630
Let's do password and then we'll do a full search

04:21.550 --> 04:27.690
and then the full search we'll give it the string so the string that we're gonna check will be that

04:27.690 --> 04:28.210
password.

04:28.420 --> 04:30.100
So let's just change this up.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.430
We'll say pattern here too.

04:33.010 --> 04:37.260
So this will be pattern to just so we name it properly and then the password

04:40.070 --> 04:43.110
is going to be string some passwords.

04:44.290 --> 04:49.290
Numbers maybe some symbols here and then ends with a number.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.630
So let's see if that works.

04:50.650 --> 04:56.320
If I do password here and I do check click Run

05:00.370 --> 05:03.800
it's not full search it should be for match.

05:03.940 --> 05:06.190
If I click Run.

05:06.390 --> 05:07.170
There you go.

05:07.170 --> 05:10.430
Everything is working as soon as I type in a letter.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.310
And here I get none.

05:13.320 --> 05:17.980
If this is less than eight characters I get none again.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.460
Very very cool.

05:20.460 --> 05:22.380
Hopefully you were able to get that.

05:22.440 --> 05:23.210
If not.

05:23.370 --> 05:30.510
Like I said I think out of this entire course this is probably the least important section I know I'm

05:30.510 --> 05:31.850
telling you this at the end.

05:31.860 --> 05:33.390
So you at least do it.

05:33.390 --> 05:38.520
But I wanted to you to know that regular expression is a thing that you might encounter and you might

05:38.520 --> 05:40.450
use throughout your career.

05:40.530 --> 05:46.140
But like I said it's one of those things that if I had to rank the importance of it's probably at the

05:46.140 --> 05:46.530
very end.

05:47.490 --> 05:49.760
So hopefully your head doesn't hurt too much.

05:49.770 --> 05:51.400
I'll see you in the next video.

05:51.410 --> 05:51.840
Bye bye.
