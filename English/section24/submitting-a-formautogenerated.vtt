WEBVTT

00:00.990 --> 00:04.080
Okay okay Andre can we finally submit this form.

00:04.350 --> 00:04.710
All right.

00:04.750 --> 00:08.670
In this video we'll finally see what happens when we submit this form.

00:09.030 --> 00:16.860
But there is one last thing that we need to include and that is the name attributes.

00:16.860 --> 00:18.340
And then I'll explain.

00:18.390 --> 00:20.980
Towards the end of this video why we need those.

00:20.990 --> 00:25.700
So we want to add in each one of our fields a name actually.

00:25.710 --> 00:28.260
So this one will be first name.

00:28.260 --> 00:31.740
And I'm just going to copy and paste here just so be a little bit faster.

00:31.740 --> 00:38.380
We have last name email password.

00:38.750 --> 00:45.560
Birthday we already have these for the radio buttons which is good.

00:46.870 --> 00:48.560
And we need here.

00:48.790 --> 00:54.530
Cat Dog Volvo Volvo OK.

00:54.740 --> 01:00.780
And we don't need it for the buns because while there's no user information there so I'm going to save

01:00.780 --> 01:07.230
that and I'm going to make this full screen so you can see I'm going to refresh the page and let's enter

01:07.230 --> 01:10.320
some fake data and see what happens.

01:10.380 --> 01:21.540
So I'm going to say fake man email addresses fake password would be 1 2 3 birthday will be mail with

01:21.540 --> 01:24.490
a cat and has an orgy.

01:24.720 --> 01:32.060
I'm going to click register now but keep an eye out up over here to see what happens when I click Did

01:32.060 --> 01:33.520
you catch that.

01:33.600 --> 01:41.300
Let's copy this because when I click register this got attached minimizes.

01:41.430 --> 01:46.060
And print this out here so we can see it for ourselves.

01:46.160 --> 01:47.910
First we have a question mark.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.880
Then first name fake.

01:49.880 --> 01:54.020
That's exactly why we entered we have last name man.

01:54.020 --> 01:55.190
Email is fake.

01:55.190 --> 01:56.960
Something something G.M. dot.com

01:59.520 --> 02:01.350
password 1 2 3 0.

02:01.410 --> 02:08.380
They know our password birthday gender and Cat on.

02:08.440 --> 02:11.640
We didn't don't select Volvo.

02:11.830 --> 02:13.900
Not sure while take a look at that later.

02:14.080 --> 02:22.390
But you can see over here that the value that the values that we entered into our form were just attached

02:22.690 --> 02:23.640
to this link.

02:23.920 --> 02:30.910
And this is actually called query strings and what it is it's one way for us to send our information

02:31.060 --> 02:36.550
to the back end or the servers because we have to store this form information somewhere so that when

02:36.550 --> 02:40.750
we come back onto this page the Web site remembers ups.

02:40.750 --> 02:51.570
This was automatically generate a nation mail five with a form but form was using an attribute called

02:51.780 --> 02:53.950
get and this get.

02:54.340 --> 03:01.650
If I left it as this will do the exact same thing where it will attach the form information to the you

03:01.650 --> 03:04.180
are out and send it to the server.

03:04.260 --> 03:12.420
There is another option where you can do post and you can try it on your own here but you wouldn't see

03:12.420 --> 03:15.890
any query parameters so this wouldn't change the bar.

03:15.900 --> 03:22.890
The top one change and that is because it will be attached to the body of the request which we'll get

03:22.890 --> 03:24.650
into when we get to that section.

03:24.650 --> 03:30.030
I don't want to confuse you too much but you can see the difference here of why we might want to use

03:30.030 --> 03:35.400
post instead of get because well what if somebody was over my shoulder and they can see my password

03:35.430 --> 03:36.300
right there in the bar.

03:36.930 --> 03:42.660
I just wanted you to get comfortable with the idea that we are sending this information to the back

03:42.660 --> 03:44.800
end the way we handle that.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.950
We'll get into later on in the course.

03:46.950 --> 03:49.660
Right now we're just focusing on the front.

03:50.220 --> 03:57.780
The last thing I want to show you was that form also has a action attribute which used to get used a

03:57.780 --> 04:08.040
lot if you saw old p HP based Web sites they'll have some sort of a action dot P HP which said submit

04:08.040 --> 04:16.110
this form and when you submit this form to the back end to the server run this script this file that's

04:16.320 --> 04:17.250
on the server.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.580
But there are better ways of doing this now.

04:19.590 --> 04:22.020
So I'll show that later on and of course

04:25.730 --> 04:29.170
let's take a look at this.

04:29.240 --> 04:35.510
So we have a question mark and this is the standard anytime there's a query string so we're adding a

04:35.510 --> 04:39.220
piece of data to our U.R.L..

04:39.350 --> 04:45.770
It starts off with the question mark which states Hey coming up we're gonna have a bunch of data for

04:45.770 --> 04:46.380
you.

04:46.640 --> 04:53.300
The first one is first name which again corresponds with the name that we have in our form and that

04:53.300 --> 04:55.340
was equal to fake.

04:55.370 --> 04:58.500
So that's property and value.

04:58.700 --> 05:10.410
So you can think of name as property and the value as men so last name first name you can see here that

05:10.410 --> 05:10.830
there's an.

05:10.830 --> 05:11.520
And sign.

05:11.520 --> 05:18.840
So that's again saying first name equals to fake and last name equals demand and email equals to fake

05:19.110 --> 05:21.390
some gibberish gmail dot com.

05:21.390 --> 05:25.140
So this is because of something called the You are all encoding.

05:25.320 --> 05:30.960
And because the U R L has special meaning for some characters such as this.

05:30.960 --> 05:39.420
And the question mark it encodes the at sign with something that it understands but it won't affect

05:39.630 --> 05:41.330
its encoding.

05:41.410 --> 05:46.990
We have password 1 2 3 birthday gender on and Cat on.

05:46.990 --> 05:55.660
And I've actually realized why the Volvo and Audie information didn't register and that is because for

05:55.900 --> 06:02.260
the query string to work as you can see it needs to have a name associated with a value so we have first

06:02.260 --> 06:03.490
name and fake.

06:03.490 --> 06:11.580
If we look at the radio bunds we have a name which is gender and we have on.

06:11.800 --> 06:17.800
So you see over here how we didn't send any value.

06:17.800 --> 06:22.690
We know that the gender some button was clicked in the gender so it's on.

06:22.690 --> 06:31.450
But we don't know which value and that is because we should have included a value for the males so that

06:31.660 --> 06:39.910
if that's the one that's selected a value will be sent and finally value.

06:40.140 --> 06:53.050
And now same with the select we should have had our name of the Select field be cars so that now the

06:53.050 --> 07:00.520
name can be associated with the value so let's give that a try one more time I'm going to delete this

07:01.780 --> 07:04.820
I'm going to save the changes that we just made.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.420
I'm going to make this full screen.

07:07.420 --> 07:11.960
Let's refresh and enter some new information.

07:12.070 --> 07:16.570
Fake new email is new.

07:16.610 --> 07:24.790
Fake G.M. dot com password is 1 2 3 4 this time birthday.

07:24.910 --> 07:30.700
Let's do female dog and Audie.

07:30.970 --> 07:36.700
I'm going to click register and let's see what we have here.

07:36.870 --> 07:45.900
We have first name fake last name is new email new Fake a G.M. dot com password 1 2 3 4 birthday gender

07:46.020 --> 07:47.180
is female.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.080
Good dog is on.

07:49.110 --> 07:50.610
OK so we've selected dog.

07:50.610 --> 07:51.090
That's great.

07:51.090 --> 07:53.520
And then cars is Hardy.

07:53.520 --> 08:01.780
There you go and that's as complicated as forms are going to get you'll encounter this a lot.

08:01.780 --> 08:08.650
And there is definitely in most Web sites that you build whether it's a landing page a web site that

08:08.650 --> 08:10.700
requires registration.

08:10.810 --> 08:13.050
This is something that you'll see a lot.

08:13.090 --> 08:19.140
Once you understand this once it makes sense you know you can call yourself an e-mail developer.

08:19.140 --> 08:21.450
So I'll see you in the next one.

08:21.450 --> 08:21.720
Bye bye.
