WEBVTT

00:01.070 --> 00:02.710
And welcome back.

00:02.720 --> 00:09.940
We're gonna get into some more advanced tags and probably the most important tag that you'll use other

00:09.950 --> 00:15.560
than the ones that we've covered so far are tags that we need to create forms.

00:15.770 --> 00:22.610
As you know when you go to Web sites usually there's some sort of a log gain or registration form so

00:22.610 --> 00:25.820
we're gonna build that out today to get started.

00:25.850 --> 00:28.740
Let's just create a new file here.

00:28.940 --> 00:38.910
We'll save it and call it register dot H2 AML on our desktop perfect and we know that we want a nice

00:38.910 --> 00:44.890
team also we use our little shortcut and we'll title it register save that.

00:45.090 --> 00:47.820
And now in the index start a simple file.

00:47.820 --> 00:57.970
Let's add a another link that references register dot ACM L and L just say here.

00:57.970 --> 00:59.430
Register.

00:59.430 --> 00:59.930
All right.

01:00.190 --> 01:05.090
We'll save both of these files and let's refresh.

01:05.320 --> 01:11.300
We have register click register while we have nothing yet but it looks like it's working.

01:11.330 --> 01:15.330
Let's add this on our new line just because it looks pretty or that way.

01:15.350 --> 01:19.500
So to do that if you remember we're going to add a brake tag.

01:19.670 --> 01:20.990
So let's refresh.

01:20.990 --> 01:21.620
There you go.

01:21.620 --> 01:25.090
We have a new page and register.

01:25.460 --> 01:34.520
Let's build out this form for you go in to register dot a simple the way we write forms in a CML while

01:34.520 --> 01:39.480
conveniently there's a form tag.

01:39.520 --> 01:44.840
But this form tag itself it needs to have the actual form inside of it.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.900
So what kind of form elements do we have.

01:47.900 --> 01:58.710
Well again if we remember our good old friend w C. Let's type in forms and we can see over here that

01:58.710 --> 02:03.480
we have a shim or forms and refresh.

02:03.590 --> 02:10.340
We'll make that full screen and you can see over here that there's a ton of information on it but you

02:10.340 --> 02:11.960
can look that up yourself.

02:11.960 --> 02:18.110
For now I'm going to introduce you to the most common ones probably the ones that you'll use 90 percent

02:18.110 --> 02:19.590
of the time.

02:19.770 --> 02:25.950
The first one as we do with any form and let's go to that page for now is what we want to enter our

02:25.950 --> 02:26.460
name.

02:26.490 --> 02:27.270
So how do we do that.

02:27.270 --> 02:40.230
We have a input tag that has a type of text because well our name will be in text form and we can close

02:40.230 --> 02:41.070
that off.

02:41.070 --> 02:43.440
And it's actually a self closing tag.

02:43.770 --> 02:47.390
So now if I save and refresh.

02:47.600 --> 02:47.800
OK.

02:47.820 --> 02:50.040
We have a little box here.

02:50.100 --> 02:52.130
Hopefully you can see that but.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.350
Well we should probably title it because we won't know what to answer that way.

02:55.350 --> 03:03.080
So we're gonna put in here we're gonna say first name semicolon and save.

03:03.090 --> 03:04.020
Let's refresh.

03:04.020 --> 03:05.110
We have a first name.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.540
And now let's make this a little bit bigger.

03:08.550 --> 03:09.400
There you go.

03:09.420 --> 03:14.950
Now you can enter your name in here awesome.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.960
Well let's let's add another one for last name

03:22.750 --> 03:27.160
and again we'll have our input type.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.740
So that's an attribute and a value of text

03:32.380 --> 03:35.240
and if we refresh we have last name.

03:35.260 --> 03:35.650
OK.

03:35.670 --> 03:41.650
But it kind of looks ugly remember that h t email just reads line by line and doesn't really know that

03:41.650 --> 03:42.940
we want a space here.

03:42.940 --> 03:52.660
So again we can add a brake tag here and refresh and we have first name and last name.

03:53.540 --> 03:53.930
OK.

03:53.980 --> 03:56.980
That's that's fairly self-explanatory.

03:56.980 --> 03:59.490
Now what else do we have in a form.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.510
We have e-mail.

04:01.690 --> 04:07.910
So let's let's add another field which is email and we'll do input.

04:08.080 --> 04:17.630
Again type calls text or add another break here because we're gonna need that spacing and let's save

04:17.960 --> 04:18.710
refresh.

04:19.130 --> 04:21.000
Awesome OK.

04:21.000 --> 04:28.480
So we have our general registration form and obviously with any form we need some sort of buttons right

04:28.560 --> 04:32.700
like we need to submit this somewhere so we can register.

04:32.700 --> 04:36.680
Well again there's a nice input type for that.

04:36.840 --> 04:40.290
So we do input instead of a text type.

04:40.290 --> 04:53.740
There is a submit type so this if we add another break in here and I see this I refresh it has a smith

04:53.740 --> 04:54.120
button.

04:55.170 --> 04:55.950
Now.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.710
Where did this submit come from.

04:58.710 --> 05:03.450
Well when you put an input type submit it automatically creates a button.

05:03.480 --> 05:07.460
And if you don't specify what to say I'll just have this text.

05:07.470 --> 05:08.870
But we can change that.

05:08.900 --> 05:18.970
So we can put value and we'll put register save that refresh.

05:19.040 --> 05:22.860
We now have a register button OK.

05:23.000 --> 05:32.630
But what if we make mistakes in this field we write stuff and what we want to reset this for again.

05:32.870 --> 05:42.970
There's a now input for that and the type of that input as you can imagine is reset.

05:42.980 --> 05:48.680
So now if we close this and other break in here actually we can keep that on the same line.

05:48.860 --> 05:52.530
We'll save refresh and we have reset.

05:52.530 --> 05:56.700
So now if I type in anything in here and let's say I don't want to.

05:56.820 --> 05:59.040
Well I don't like this I need to reset the form.

05:59.070 --> 06:03.630
I can just click reset and it clears everything for us.

06:03.710 --> 06:06.230
You may be asking yourself you know what.

06:06.230 --> 06:10.360
What happens when we click register before we get into that.

06:10.370 --> 06:15.800
I want to just go through all the common input types and then we'll click registers to see what happens

06:16.580 --> 06:23.720
with the e mail we ideally want first of all for it to be required so that when you click register if

06:23.720 --> 06:29.810
you haven't provided an email it won't let you register and there's an attribute that we can use for

06:29.810 --> 06:30.040
that.

06:30.050 --> 06:40.520
And that is required and here we don't actually have to specify a value because automatically it's assumed

06:40.520 --> 06:45.310
that required equals to true which means that this form field is required.

06:45.320 --> 06:55.490
So if I say that I refresh and I leave it blank and I click register will say please fill out this field.

06:55.540 --> 07:00.070
Now we also want to make sure that it's a an appropriate email field.

07:00.070 --> 07:06.120
So if I type something like this we still want to make sure that you know this is an incorrect email

07:06.130 --> 07:12.280
we don't want to register so the input type of text that I told you for e-mail is actually wrong.

07:12.320 --> 07:17.470
There's a specific one that we can use which is as you can imagine email.

07:17.480 --> 07:26.950
So now if I refresh and type in something that's not an email and I click register I'll say please include

07:26.950 --> 07:30.700
an app and the immunologists very nice.

07:30.740 --> 07:37.110
It's kind of like magic it does this for you which is very very nice let's expand on our knowledge of

07:37.170 --> 07:44.270
inputs and add a few more fields that will most likely need usually one m no somebodies birthday.

07:44.520 --> 07:52.710
So let's add birthday here and for this input type let's do type

07:55.450 --> 08:04.510
date so if I say this and I refresh at that we have a nice little dick picker so I can pick anything

08:04.510 --> 08:06.450
in here.

08:06.480 --> 08:06.810
All right.

08:06.810 --> 08:07.800
What else do we need.

08:07.800 --> 08:14.240
We also need gender so we'll do input type and for gender.

08:14.250 --> 08:22.430
While there's no specific input type for gender but there is something called Radio and Radio is as

08:22.430 --> 08:25.440
the name suggest radio buttons.

08:25.460 --> 08:28.940
So now click refresh and.

08:29.440 --> 08:33.610
Well I have one radio button but we ideally want to have options right.

08:33.610 --> 08:34.980
So how do we do that.

08:34.990 --> 08:43.210
So for the radio we also need to say whether it's male or female let's have within the gender.

08:43.270 --> 08:54.970
We're gonna have a break over here in the line and we'll say input type radio and we'll say male.

08:55.150 --> 09:02.370
And we also want female and we also want

09:05.460 --> 09:11.990
and when we refreshes we have male female and other BI You see a problem here.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.160
I just click the radio buttons and I can't deselect them and ideally you can own.

09:17.190 --> 09:20.120
You should only be able to select one.

09:20.370 --> 09:25.530
And right now the way the radio buttons are they don't know of each other's exist and we want to make

09:25.530 --> 09:32.010
sure that they know that they're connected their family and only one of them can be picked.

09:32.010 --> 09:36.760
So how do we do that the way we do that is through the name attribute.

09:37.470 --> 09:47.550
So for the name we'll say gender and this name attribute needs to match on all the radio buttons so

09:47.550 --> 09:54.030
that they know they are together they're part of the gender input field.

09:54.060 --> 10:03.630
So if I safe here and refresh now you can see that I can only select one.

10:03.650 --> 10:04.030
All right.

10:04.030 --> 10:04.810
Perfect.

10:04.810 --> 10:06.370
What else should he have.

10:06.370 --> 10:14.450
Well let's say I really want to know if you have pets with pets.

10:14.550 --> 10:18.700
We're gonna have inputs type.

10:18.990 --> 10:27.080
Well we can have multiple pets so won't be radio buttons we want checkbox so checkbox we wanted to have

10:27.740 --> 10:35.390
cats or lizards but cat and we want to have

10:38.540 --> 10:39.290
can type today

10:41.950 --> 10:48.170
checkbox and we want to have dogs so let's save that.

10:48.250 --> 10:51.190
Let's refresh and look about.

10:51.280 --> 10:57.960
We have pets but this time is checkboxes which means I can select multiple.
