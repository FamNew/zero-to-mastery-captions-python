00:01.260 --> 00:09.000
I want to introduce you to one last former element and it's actually not an input with a type as we've

00:09.000 --> 00:14.380
described before it's a little bit different but the idea is still the same.

00:14.520 --> 00:23.700
So let's add cars here and we want this to be a drop down menu again something that we see very often

00:24.060 --> 00:25.450
and form fields.

00:25.470 --> 00:36.360
However unlike an input tag we have to do a select tag means a closing select tag as well and within

00:36.360 --> 00:39.250
here we can put in our options.

00:39.360 --> 00:52.650
So the option will be will have a value of Volvo Nabucco and we'll say Volvo because we want that actually

00:52.650 --> 00:58.880
printed to the screen and again we have to close that tag we'll add

01:02.690 --> 01:03.110
Audie

01:06.130 --> 01:09.090
and we'll close that tag as well and we can keep adding them.

01:09.130 --> 01:11.870
But for now just two is fine.

01:11.950 --> 01:18.130
If I save this and I refresh we have cars let's add a brake here

01:21.250 --> 01:22.350
just so it looks nicer.

01:22.360 --> 01:22.990
There you go.

01:23.140 --> 01:26.730
And here now we have a drop down menu.

01:27.250 --> 01:32.050
Let's say you want to extend this or you want to see what kind of properties you can put with select

01:32.140 --> 01:33.620
the way you go about it.

01:33.640 --> 01:41.510
As you know we've done this before we type in H2 email select tag and actually Google gives you a nice

01:41.510 --> 01:47.480
little info page over here with attributes so you can see over here we can use multiple which is specifies

01:47.480 --> 01:50.410
that a multiple options can be selected at once.

01:50.570 --> 01:51.710
So let's do that.

01:51.710 --> 01:52.250
Let's.

01:53.390 --> 01:55.300
Let's minimize this.

01:55.340 --> 01:57.030
Perfect.

01:57.080 --> 02:09.100
And within select we'll put multiple we refresh and we can actually select multiple elements but that

02:09.100 --> 02:13.690
doesn't look that pretty so I'm going to take that out and refresh.

02:13.690 --> 02:20.600
I actually realized that we forgot one important input type so I'm going to throw it in there as a bonus.

02:20.680 --> 02:26.030
And as you know with any registration form we want a password.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.960
So let's add that right after the email

02:32.230 --> 02:42.960
will do and put type and yes there is a password type that we can add and this password type will have

02:43.770 --> 02:50.550
another achieve you that's kind of cool and that is men which is how many the minimum characters that

02:50.610 --> 02:52.700
a password needs gas.

02:52.710 --> 02:58.390
So let's save that refresh and let's add a break here.

02:58.410 --> 03:01.780
So it looks pretty refresh.

03:02.150 --> 03:05.180
And now the password field look at that.

03:05.300 --> 03:08.570
It acts like a password field.

03:08.660 --> 03:08.840
All right.

03:09.350 --> 03:12.800
Let's submit this form and see what hap.
