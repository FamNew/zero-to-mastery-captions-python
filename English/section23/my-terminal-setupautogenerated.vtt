00:01.230 --> 00:08.380
In this video we're going to setup our terminal to look nice along our newly setup sublime text as you

00:08.380 --> 00:14.590
know the terminal is just a text based way to communicate with the computer instead of the graphical

00:14.590 --> 00:18.860
user interface that we normally use as developers.

00:18.940 --> 00:24.400
You will spend a lot of time with the terminal especially as you become more and more senior in your

00:24.400 --> 00:25.630
role.

00:25.630 --> 00:26.910
So let's make it better.

00:27.890 --> 00:32.240
If we open up the terminal I have it open already for myself.

00:32.370 --> 00:36.060
You see that we have the word bash here.

00:36.060 --> 00:41.670
Bash is a type of shell that a terminal can have.

00:41.670 --> 00:43.460
And what do I mean by that.

00:43.470 --> 00:50.670
Well just as a name suggests it's just the casing around the terminal that is customizable.

00:50.670 --> 00:53.850
There's actually more than one shell.

00:53.850 --> 00:55.550
Bash is just one of them.

00:55.680 --> 00:59.070
One of my favorites are Oh my zest H.

00:59.070 --> 01:06.960
There's the fish shell and they all have different things that you can do with them but it's just another

01:06.960 --> 01:10.550
way to customize your workstation.

01:10.800 --> 01:18.480
Before I get into that let's just customize our bash the way we do that is we can first start off with

01:18.630 --> 01:21.790
getting something other than just having this to the lot.

01:21.900 --> 01:31.530
The way we do that is we type in Nano which is a text editor and then we do squiggly line slash dot

01:31.540 --> 01:40.900
bash underscore profile and here where we opened is a file that is the batch profile so that this is

01:41.110 --> 01:43.040
what our profile will look like.

01:43.090 --> 01:48.760
This file it gets read every time we open up the terminal in here we can put in a bunch of things that

01:48.760 --> 01:50.440
we want our terminal to do.

01:50.470 --> 01:58.510
One of the cool things that I really think is fun is updating your P.S. One variable and I'll link to

01:58.510 --> 02:01.900
this Web site and there's a bunch of examples here that we can use.

02:01.900 --> 02:10.190
Let's just pick one that like this one over here all we do is copy and paste this and within our batch

02:10.190 --> 02:17.690
profile we can just copy and paste and as you can see our P.S. 1 now equals a whole bunch of gibberish

02:17.720 --> 02:19.090
that we don't really need to worry about.

02:19.280 --> 02:27.530
And we see over here that to say we need to do control X then save modify we just press Y and then press

02:27.560 --> 02:29.950
enter okay.

02:30.040 --> 02:39.770
Nothing happens but the way we fix that is we now do source and then bash profile.

02:39.870 --> 02:44.220
It essentially reloads our profile now and look at that.

02:44.220 --> 02:47.900
We now have a cool little prompt to the left.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.400
So you can set up your piece want to display whatever you want if you want to your current directory

02:53.400 --> 02:54.020
to display.

02:54.020 --> 02:56.160
That's great if you want your user name to display.

02:56.160 --> 02:57.840
That's good as well.

02:57.900 --> 03:00.350
You can set up in a ton of ways.

03:00.360 --> 03:05.190
The other thing that the terminal lets you do if you click on something like add a background color

03:05.820 --> 03:09.000
you'll get a few things that you can change in your shell.

03:09.060 --> 03:12.980
You can change your color based on what you want.

03:13.230 --> 03:20.370
And if I bring this over here you can also click on the profile and actually it gives you a bunch of

03:20.520 --> 03:22.820
pre-built ones that look really cool.

03:22.890 --> 03:24.540
Let's do pro actually green.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.830
Again you can customize this as well.

03:26.850 --> 03:33.480
And as I mentioned a different operating system you have your own ways to customize it but every single

03:33.480 --> 03:39.060
one usually has a profile and a way to modify what gets displayed based on your needs.

03:39.070 --> 03:47.610
Now the one that I really really like is a shell that's different than bash and I've used this one before

03:47.610 --> 03:51.600
which is really really good it has a ton of themes that you can use.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.080
They have a bunch of options and you can play through them.

03:54.180 --> 03:56.710
The one that I really like is the fish shell.

03:56.730 --> 03:58.060
It's very simple.

03:58.110 --> 04:06.010
It has all the operating systems on it and I install it using homebrew for those on a Mac homebrew is

04:06.460 --> 04:09.010
a way to install anything from the web.

04:09.010 --> 04:15.060
So instead of me going to a Web site and installing something I can use a command line to download things.

04:15.070 --> 04:21.580
If you go to the homebrew Web site brewed out SDH You can actually just copy this link into your terminal

04:21.790 --> 04:28.900
copy and paste it press enter and it will install homebrew for you I already have this installed so

04:29.110 --> 04:34.100
I'll just exit that the way I install fish.

04:34.120 --> 04:39.740
You can see over here all I have to do is say brew install fish.

04:39.920 --> 04:45.470
And while this is happening I want to show you another option so we have the terminal over here.

04:45.560 --> 04:52.930
But I term which again is specific for Mac is really really nice and it's way more customizable than

04:52.940 --> 04:53.720
the terminal.

04:53.810 --> 05:02.890
So I prefer using a term to if I open this and double click and look at that.

05:02.890 --> 05:13.050
This looks way nicer already so let's just compare them side by side I have my let's make that a little

05:13.050 --> 05:13.840
bit bigger.

05:13.920 --> 05:23.220
I have the bash shell here and I have the fish shell here although they both are in the desktop right

05:23.220 --> 05:24.240
now.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.520
They're running on different shells.

05:27.750 --> 05:36.540
The fish Shell has just like we had with the bass profile has its own profile so you can set it up and

05:36.540 --> 05:42.950
you can set up which one gets activated when you first open up the terminal or ITER.

05:42.960 --> 05:49.140
What I recommend is to setup your workstation in a way that's nice to you.

05:49.140 --> 05:56.630
My preferred way is to use ITER and the fish show but if you want to use Bash that's great.

05:56.630 --> 06:03.290
The beauty here is that if I type in bash I get taken to the bash profile and if I type in fish I get

06:03.290 --> 06:05.390
back to fish.

06:05.470 --> 06:12.260
Item Also lets you just customize everything really nicely if I go to preferences you'll see here that

06:12.380 --> 06:19.640
I have appearance profiles where we can have colors set up and there's a ton more you can do with your

06:19.640 --> 06:25.120
terminal that I won't get into into this video because everybody has their own way of doing things.

06:25.130 --> 06:34.520
I just wanted to show you a basic setup so that now you have a nice environment that you can work in.

06:34.590 --> 06:36.310
I'll see in the next one by.
