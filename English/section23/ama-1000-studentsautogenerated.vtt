00:01.430 --> 00:08.960
Hello and welcome to the Ask Me Anything video that I just am promptly decided to do after we had a

00:08.960 --> 00:14.750
thousand students which was just last week and we already have over two thousand students.

00:14.750 --> 00:17.750
So I want to start off by saying Absolutely thank you.

00:17.780 --> 00:20.710
Thank you so much for being part of this course.

00:20.750 --> 00:23.400
It is beyond what I expected.

00:23.420 --> 00:29.390
I thought I'll get a couple of hundred and call it a success but I've really really loved interacting

00:29.390 --> 00:35.410
with a lot of you we have students from over 100 countries and everybody is so excited to learn with

00:35.420 --> 00:36.790
so many different backgrounds.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.560
And I just love the community that has come out of it.

00:39.620 --> 00:45.090
Like I said it was beyond my expectation and I love that everybody so excited about learning to code.

00:45.230 --> 00:47.220
So thank you so much.

00:47.230 --> 00:51.800
You know I've created a couple of videos for you to watch but I think the community this forming around

00:51.800 --> 00:59.780
it that's supporting each other and hopefully in a few months helping each other to become the web developers

00:59.780 --> 01:00.590
that they want to be.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.300
I think that's the most amazing part.

01:02.300 --> 01:04.220
So again thank you so much.

01:04.220 --> 01:08.870
I'm just gonna answer a few questions that some of you have asked to celebrate getting to a thousand

01:09.440 --> 01:10.830
students.

01:10.850 --> 01:17.810
The first one that I see over here is from Ashley and she asked what was your biggest hurdle after learning

01:17.810 --> 01:20.210
starting a new career field.

01:20.210 --> 01:26.140
I think the biggest hurdle that I encountered was definitely the imposter syndrome.

01:26.150 --> 01:27.290
You may have heard of it.

01:27.350 --> 01:32.480
It's the idea that you feel like an imposter you feel like everybody else knows this stuff except you

01:32.480 --> 01:37.930
sit in a room and people start talking and you realize that you have no clue what's going on.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.250
You're afraid to ask questions.

01:40.370 --> 01:46.710
And I think that's the biggest hurdle realizing that when you read something or watch videos online.

01:47.120 --> 01:52.420
People have practiced this and made sure that there's no mistakes in their writing and their videos.

01:52.420 --> 01:53.870
And I did this as well.

01:54.890 --> 02:03.560
And what this means is that what we project onto our videos or onto our blog post isn't exactly us being

02:03.560 --> 02:10.190
perfect it's us iterating and making sure that we check our mistakes and fix them so nobody out there

02:10.190 --> 02:14.420
knows every single answer about web development or coding.

02:14.420 --> 02:18.200
We all are beginners and we are problem solvers.

02:18.200 --> 02:23.640
We're really really good at solving problems not just dictionaries that know everything.

02:23.990 --> 02:32.030
So really realize that you're not an imposter or you're not less than everybody else.

02:32.060 --> 02:37.310
Everybody has these difficulties and I think the biggest thing you can do as a developer is ask a lot

02:37.310 --> 02:38.190
of questions.

02:38.230 --> 02:40.310
Any time you don't know something ask questions.

02:40.310 --> 02:42.690
Don't feel like you don't.

02:42.920 --> 02:47.630
You're the only one that doesn't know most likely other people in the room don't know except they are

02:47.870 --> 02:51.110
afraid to ask a question and raise their hand.

02:51.110 --> 02:57.410
So I think that's the biggest hurdle you got over that and you get comfortable asking questions to your

02:57.410 --> 03:03.710
co-workers and when you don't understand something I did that a lot when I first started coding and

03:03.740 --> 03:09.980
I was able to get answers and progress a lot faster than most people that didn't ask questions.

03:09.980 --> 03:10.160
All right.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.640
So next question was from Mike.

03:13.700 --> 03:18.170
Other than javascript what is the most important language to learn.

03:18.170 --> 03:24.290
I have to say probably other than Javascript Python is a really good language to learn mostly because

03:24.290 --> 03:30.650
it's used a lot in machine learning and it's a very very fast growing field and I'm going to write a

03:30.650 --> 03:36.980
little bit of a blog post on it so people can get familiar with it but python is definitely interesting.

03:37.040 --> 03:46.100
The other one I'd say is solidity which is the coding language that is used in building distributed

03:46.100 --> 03:47.970
applications for the area.

03:48.400 --> 03:53.810
If you haven't heard about block chain and all the hype with cryptocurrency I think solidity is a really

03:53.810 --> 03:54.440
interesting one.

03:54.440 --> 03:59.630
In 2018 we're going to see a lot of distributed applications being created and there's a huge demand

03:59.630 --> 04:02.050
for developers who know that language.

04:02.570 --> 04:05.500
So I think those two are pretty pretty exciting.

04:05.510 --> 04:08.860
I'll be writing a blog post about it so you can get more information.

04:09.230 --> 04:13.770
You should look into those as well as javascript but focus on javascript first.

04:13.790 --> 04:14.240
All right.

04:14.240 --> 04:21.740
Next question was by Wasim and he asked if you were to hire a reactive helper from students who completed

04:21.740 --> 04:22.730
this course.

04:22.830 --> 04:26.040
What would be what do you can't read today.

04:26.060 --> 04:30.100
What would you be looking for and what questions would you ask.

04:30.100 --> 04:30.840
All right.

04:30.980 --> 04:35.360
So I think I would ask number one what's the benefit of react.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.950
Did they just learn a couple of syntax and no reactive.

04:37.960 --> 04:41.070
Do they actually know what problems react solves.

04:41.090 --> 04:44.800
And I go over that in the course so hopefully you understand it as well.

04:45.350 --> 04:50.750
And then I'll also ask about what are its shortcomings when is it a bad time to use react.

04:50.750 --> 04:56.120
Because I've seen a lot of people who get really really excited about the technology and think it's

04:56.120 --> 04:57.590
the greatest gift ever.

04:57.590 --> 05:04.210
Without understanding that not every problem can be solved by one library.

05:04.290 --> 05:07.560
I think react is great for some things but not for everything.

05:07.710 --> 05:13.820
And there are a lot of shortcomings that come with react that you should know as well.

05:13.830 --> 05:21.510
Because if you were able to understand the pros and cons Well I think that you truly understand the

05:21.510 --> 05:25.860
library and you were able to make a good decision as a developer and it's something that I tried to

05:25.860 --> 05:31.710
do in this course which is not necessarily learn a bunch of functions and ways to do things but deeply

05:31.710 --> 05:38.040
understand and know what problems they solve and when they're good to use and if you deeply understand

05:38.040 --> 05:45.240
that then I would 100 percent hire somebody because I know that they have deep knowledge about something

05:45.270 --> 05:51.860
and not something superficial which in turn means that they're able to do more than just follow instructions.

05:51.870 --> 05:56.700
They're able to think on their own and doesn't just follow the rules and follow what I say but can think

05:56.700 --> 05:58.770
for themselves and make good decisions.

06:00.210 --> 06:05.850
All right next one by Josh which programming blogs do you read most frequently.

06:05.850 --> 06:07.260
I definitely like Medium.

06:07.290 --> 06:10.630
Medium is great for technical blog posts.

06:10.740 --> 06:16.890
If you haven't been there before just medium dot com and just follow anything.

06:17.130 --> 06:22.560
Actually I would say just follow the top 10 articles daily and see browse through them and see which

06:22.560 --> 06:24.270
ones are related to technology.

06:24.270 --> 06:25.970
I think they're really really good.

06:25.970 --> 06:30.900
It's actually how I started this course I wrote a medium blog post that became very popular and I thought

06:30.930 --> 06:37.980
hey maybe I should create a course the other one is software engineering daily and that's a podcast

06:38.250 --> 06:44.010
that is really really good and it's not just about web development it's just about software engineering

06:44.010 --> 06:47.210
in general and it can get very technical at times.

06:47.230 --> 06:52.590
It really gives you a good grasp of what's out there and the technology as it evolves.

06:52.590 --> 06:58.500
And then finally for JavaScript there is a javascript weekly newsletter you can google that and sign

06:58.500 --> 07:02.140
up for it and every week you'll give you updates on javascript.

07:02.340 --> 07:03.540
A few more questions we have.

07:03.540 --> 07:06.470
What did you do prior to your career change.

07:06.540 --> 07:14.430
So actually had an interesting career I guess I used to train tour directors around the world so I'd

07:14.430 --> 07:18.420
fly to Costa Rica for example and train people.

07:18.450 --> 07:24.870
I also had a small business that actually saw on yoga and surf retreats.

07:24.940 --> 07:30.720
I've always worked with people and every once in a while I need a Web site made and I would give a bunch

07:30.720 --> 07:35.520
of money to a developer and never know what was happening behind the scenes.

07:35.580 --> 07:41.100
The finished product would never come as I wanted it and it was kind of this black hole that I was storing

07:41.100 --> 07:45.600
money into so I wanted to learn it for myself and that's kind of how I got into the field and next thing

07:45.600 --> 07:52.560
you know I really really enjoyed it and decided to make the career move based on the fact that a it's

07:52.560 --> 07:55.940
a great industry to be in and that I found it interesting.

07:55.950 --> 07:59.710
The next question was How did you get your first job as a DEP.

07:59.930 --> 08:06.450
It's actually got my job as a developer five months after well after his training with a Shia mile I

08:06.450 --> 08:11.040
didn't know what a small CSI is javascript any of that stuff was don't really know how the internet

08:11.040 --> 08:11.890
worked.

08:12.060 --> 08:18.950
Five months later I got a job and now even as a junior developer but as an intermediate developer that's

08:18.990 --> 08:24.900
nothing to show off but just to show you how fast you can progress through this career.

08:25.050 --> 08:29.190
If you really work for it and understand the fundamentals.

08:29.190 --> 08:35.430
So the first shot that I got actually applied by messaging a bunch of companies that I was interested

08:35.430 --> 08:41.100
in and finding their email their CEO's email and letting them know that I was interesting in a role

08:41.100 --> 08:45.090
and that I was solving a specific problem that they had.

08:45.090 --> 08:51.780
So research a company and say hey I noticed that you know your website or your app could have this and

08:51.780 --> 08:52.740
just fixed.

08:52.800 --> 09:01.740
This is how I would do it or I would message a CEO and be like Hey these are my past past achievements.

09:01.740 --> 09:08.010
I've recently turned into a developer and I guarantee you I will work twice as hard as anybody else

09:08.010 --> 09:15.660
on the team and just kind of make a friend promise I guess in order to really castrate attention.

09:15.690 --> 09:20.920
So another question was how did the interview go.

09:21.000 --> 09:28.440
I actually had multiple offers when I first got my developer role and I think I was able to get those

09:28.440 --> 09:36.300
offers not because I was the best developer in the world and by no means am I done now but I think in

09:36.300 --> 09:43.470
the interview what I was able to do was to convince them that I will work harder than everybody else

09:44.700 --> 09:50.170
and I made sure to do that by showcasing that hey I come from a different background.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.290
I'm not a computer programmer.

09:52.310 --> 09:58.290
I graduated with with a degree and I turned that actually into an advantage by telling them all the

09:58.290 --> 10:04.880
other things that I've done beforehand and then finally showing them that I was a self-taught programmer

10:04.910 --> 10:11.240
just like yourselves and showing that I had the ambition and determination so that by the end of the

10:11.240 --> 10:17.990
interview I was able to convince them that although I may not be the most skilled developer out there

10:18.500 --> 10:25.250
I'd be the hardest working and I would make sure that I would learn these things so that I'd become

10:25.250 --> 10:27.020
a really really valuable employee.

10:27.020 --> 10:33.530
In six months and I think if you're able to do that you'll be surprised how many more offers you'll

10:33.530 --> 10:39.590
get because there are a lot of developers out there but it's really really hard to find developers who

10:40.290 --> 10:44.400
a can have can follow instructions.

10:44.540 --> 10:52.490
B can work hard and c aren't so confident in their abilities that they have a narrow vision and don't

10:52.490 --> 10:53.390
take others inputs.

10:54.260 --> 10:58.490
So if you're able to convince somebody that you're going to help them out do your homework really really

10:58.490 --> 11:02.390
hard and that you're gonna be an asset to them that will make their life easier.

11:02.390 --> 11:06.990
I think that is a great great way to land a job.

11:07.140 --> 11:07.330
All right.

11:07.340 --> 11:12.500
Next question from when is three books that have inspired you in some way.

11:12.500 --> 11:19.040
And I've chosen non coding related books just because I think the coding related books all the popular

11:19.040 --> 11:24.330
ones everybody knows or you can google them around but the three books that have really inspired me.

11:24.350 --> 11:30.110
One is the four hour workweek that by Tim Ferriss that some of you may have heard of.

11:30.110 --> 11:32.260
It's a very popular book.

11:32.450 --> 11:40.790
I don't like the actual content tips and tricks but I really like the way that Tim thinks and he thinks

11:40.910 --> 11:49.280
in efficiency and I'm obsessed with using our limited time to the most efficient degree possible.

11:49.370 --> 11:57.250
So that means what is the best way for me to learn a topic and now waste my time.

11:57.260 --> 12:01.670
What is the best way for me to learn something and get rewards as soon as possible.

12:01.730 --> 12:04.420
And I'm sure you can notice in this course.

12:04.430 --> 12:05.510
That's what I did.

12:05.510 --> 12:11.330
I wanted to find the most efficient way possible to start earning money as fast as we can and start

12:11.330 --> 12:13.570
working in teams as soon as we can.

12:13.580 --> 12:19.670
Because while we have limited time and we're able to learn a lot more when we're surrounded by others

12:19.670 --> 12:21.960
when we're working in development.

12:22.550 --> 12:30.080
So that book not just in developing has really influenced my life to make sure that I think critically

12:30.080 --> 12:39.080
about what I do to grow and career personally financially and emotionally just everything to try and

12:39.380 --> 12:42.670
look at everything and now analyze things.

12:42.680 --> 12:47.230
The second book was the so good they can't ignore you.

12:47.480 --> 12:54.920
And this book is by Cal Newport and it's a book that I read and it changed my thinking completely once

12:54.920 --> 13:02.370
again and it taught the idea that passion isn't really a thing when we're young we we think that you

13:02.370 --> 13:10.630
know we're passionate about traveling we're passionate about surfing and we try and follow this passion.

13:10.640 --> 13:17.300
But this book argues that passion naturally develops from mastery from becoming really really good at

13:17.300 --> 13:22.250
a skill where people start paying you money for it and you become respected and in your field and people

13:22.250 --> 13:24.210
have admiration for you.

13:24.310 --> 13:31.970
And when you become really really good at math sir at your craft well that's when you become content

13:32.060 --> 13:35.240
with your life that's when you feel like you're providing value to people.

13:35.270 --> 13:40.070
And that book has really really shaped the last couple of years for me.

13:40.070 --> 13:47.240
It's why I've I've really got into coding and I've really started to enjoy it more and more it's because

13:47.240 --> 13:48.770
I've become better and better at it.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.240
So I highly recommend that book.

13:50.450 --> 13:57.050
Finally the third book is smart cuts by Shane Snow and this is a book that I recommend to everybody

13:57.590 --> 14:02.710
taking that course especially those that don't come from a computer science background.

14:02.720 --> 14:12.590
It talks about how you can actually climb the ladder of success not by just you know following the traditional

14:12.590 --> 14:16.140
path by but by jumping from side to side from it.

14:16.160 --> 14:20.320
For example you are you are an actor and now you want to become a developer.

14:20.330 --> 14:26.530
Well this book argues that that's actually better because you're able to use whatever you learned into

14:26.540 --> 14:33.920
that field and jump on this other ladder of developing and use those skills that no other person has

14:34.370 --> 14:40.670
such as communicating with people and being empathetically and mimicking body language from each other.

14:40.700 --> 14:43.550
That's something that you know not a lot of developers know.

14:43.580 --> 14:48.310
So using those side skills to your advantage you can definitely check out the book.

14:48.320 --> 14:52.430
It's really really good highly recommended right now.

14:52.430 --> 14:55.770
Next question your opinion on the block chain technology.

14:55.850 --> 14:56.870
Very very cool stuff.

14:56.870 --> 15:01.920
I'm actually really interested in it and writing a blog post on it.

15:01.950 --> 15:06.990
I think everybody should learn the block chain data structure you can actually do it in JavaScript and

15:06.990 --> 15:10.350
build this simple one quite easily in a day.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.810
And I think it's very very exciting.

15:12.810 --> 15:15.210
I think there's a lot of hype around it.

15:15.240 --> 15:19.500
I wouldn't recommend investing in it but you know t Sharon.

15:19.500 --> 15:25.890
I think that technology is actually very interesting and there will be big change in 2018 and the field

15:25.890 --> 15:28.390
will grow really really fast.

15:28.410 --> 15:35.880
This is getting long so last two questions we have what is the meaning of life.

15:35.950 --> 15:38.380
I'm probably the worst person to ask that too.

15:38.430 --> 15:39.200
I have no idea.

15:39.230 --> 15:45.660
But I can't tell you one thing that I live my life by and I heard it somewhere I wish I could credit

15:45.660 --> 15:53.310
the person that I heard it from provide more value than you capture and I think that's really interesting.

15:53.580 --> 16:00.810
And this what I did tried to do with the course I tried to provide a lot of value as much as I could.

16:00.870 --> 16:07.290
And now there are times that are really really sucked making this course because it took a lot of hours

16:07.290 --> 16:14.730
a lot of editing and a lot of times where I didn't like the video site to redo it over but I wanted

16:14.730 --> 16:19.450
to provide something really valuable and just capture a little bit of the benefit.

16:19.680 --> 16:26.070
And I like this way of thinking I like this idea of providing out as much value not necessarily capturing

16:26.070 --> 16:32.680
it and getting upset if you know your course gets copied and taunted and people downloaded for free.

16:32.730 --> 16:37.860
If you're able to help a bunch of people that's great if you're able to capture a bit of the benefit

16:38.130 --> 16:43.650
that's great as well but I think that's a really nice way of looking at things and if we all strive

16:43.650 --> 16:49.500
to do that as web developers to to capture a little bit of the value that we provide to the world I

16:49.500 --> 16:55.190
think the world would be a better better place right.

16:55.560 --> 16:56.770
Last question.

16:56.970 --> 17:00.420
How many messages do you get every day from your students.

17:00.420 --> 17:06.320
I mean this number has definitely increased.

17:06.430 --> 17:11.700
You know I'm very very excited about I can't believe that we have over two thousand students now and

17:11.760 --> 17:17.310
I definitely spend a lot of time I wish I kept track of things but you know I wake up in the morning

17:17.310 --> 17:19.700
I spend about an hour answering messages.

17:19.710 --> 17:26.460
Then in the afternoon I spend another hour to answering messages and questions and again at night I

17:26.460 --> 17:31.450
do that as well and if I don't do that three times a day I won't be able to keep up with it.

17:31.470 --> 17:36.610
I'll have to figure out a better system too because I do want to answer each student.

17:36.610 --> 17:42.330
I want to I want people to feel comfortable asking me as many questions as they can but I do also want

17:42.330 --> 17:49.350
to continue providing new videos and evolving the course to be better and better based on feedback.

17:50.190 --> 17:52.540
So we'll see.

17:52.560 --> 17:58.440
It's been it's been so much fun right now and so exciting that some of you know I've quit my job to

17:58.440 --> 18:07.170
focus on this course full time so all the feedback all the community and everybody that's that's helping

18:07.170 --> 18:12.120
me out on slack answering questions and trying to form open source projects.

18:12.480 --> 18:18.750
It's been really really fun and this is probably the most fun I've got working in my life and for that

18:18.810 --> 18:25.020
I really really thank you I think you're all amazing and I think what I provide to you is perhaps 20

18:25.020 --> 18:31.290
percent of the value I think the community and the support that we're creating with this course is the

18:31.290 --> 18:36.750
big benefit and I hope it keeps growing and I hope it becomes something bigger than I ever envisioned

18:36.780 --> 18:41.520
and I hope all of you by the end of this get what you want out of it.

18:41.520 --> 18:48.440
Whether to improve your skills to get a job or just to get a little bit smarter.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.960
I'll see you in the next video.

18:50.970 --> 18:53.190
Thanks for watching.

18:53.190 --> 18:57.420
My face stopped for I don't know how long this video is but it felt really really long.

18:58.050 --> 19:00.420
I really really appreciate all of you.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.010
Thanks so much.

19:02.010 --> 19:02.630
Bye bye.
