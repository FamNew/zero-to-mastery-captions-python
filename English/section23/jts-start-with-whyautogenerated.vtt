00:01.940 --> 00:09.320
This is something that we started our course with the idea that when learning something with our limited

00:09.440 --> 00:17.460
time and resource we need to make sure that we understand the most important concept.

00:17.540 --> 00:20.200
Why are we learning this.

00:20.340 --> 00:29.210
Why is this worth my time and why is this something that I should dedicate this time to too often we

00:29.210 --> 00:32.360
see new things in the developer ecosystem.

00:32.360 --> 00:38.320
It is always exciting to be working on the newest and shiniest thing that everybody is talking about.

00:38.570 --> 00:45.860
But remember those libraries and frameworks and configuration files and tools.

00:45.860 --> 00:47.910
Those things come and go.

00:48.140 --> 00:50.270
They're always changing.

00:50.270 --> 00:57.500
You can be a master of Westpac one day and two years later nobody cares because there's a better tool

00:57.500 --> 00:58.500
out there.

00:58.580 --> 01:06.350
The things that stick around are the fundamental computer science topics and software development practices.

01:06.380 --> 01:15.200
Sure these things change over time as well but they always evolve slowly with Y in mind when learning

01:15.200 --> 01:16.340
new things.

01:16.490 --> 01:20.660
Make sure you understand why the solution was created.

01:20.660 --> 01:29.900
What problem is it solving and why is this the answer to your problems if you're able to do this you

01:29.900 --> 01:34.580
stop being a player in the game of catch up in the developer ecosystem.

01:34.580 --> 01:41.390
Always trying to learn the latest library the newest tool the coolest functions to learn.

01:41.470 --> 01:46.570
It's like a game of hamster who's constantly trying to keep up with the wheel trying to run on that

01:46.570 --> 01:54.760
wheel but instead be an observer who is watching the ecosystem evolve from above.

01:56.530 --> 02:04.180
Watch how new libraries come and go understand the why of each libraries what problems they self understand

02:04.270 --> 02:14.020
the big picture why we do things but be the observer not the hamster you'll have a happier longer career

02:14.380 --> 02:15.270
overall.

02:15.370 --> 02:20.310
Trust me you won't be constantly trying to catch up with every library and framework.

02:20.320 --> 02:29.530
This way this big picture vision is what makes a senior developer or a manager or a leader.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.020
They don't have narrow vision.

02:32.020 --> 02:38.550
They see the entire ecosystem and they are able to make smart decisions because of that.

02:38.550 --> 02:40.930
So always start with why.
