The most successful people that I know and I'm not just talking about developers I'm talking about all

00:06.860 --> 00:11.200
the successful people that I know are masters of learning.

00:11.260 --> 00:14.510
We all have the same amount of time in the day.

00:14.560 --> 00:23.930
Twenty three hours 56 minutes and twenty six seconds however some people are able to accomplish more

00:23.930 --> 00:25.670
than others.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.870
Why is that.

00:27.880 --> 00:30.640
I'm a big proponent of efficiency.

00:31.090 --> 00:38.200
If you're able to learn something in much less time than somebody else then you can compound the benefit

00:38.590 --> 00:40.190
over your lifetime.

00:40.210 --> 00:47.290
Now I know many people have different learning abilities but this isn't a contest with others.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.580
This is a contest within yourself.

00:49.600 --> 00:53.570
Figure out what makes you successful and learning.

00:53.710 --> 00:59.350
Don't compare yourself to others whether you're a visual learner or maybe you need to take breaks every

00:59.350 --> 01:00.840
30 minutes.

01:00.910 --> 01:04.300
Figure out what your best learning style is.

01:04.300 --> 01:06.430
Learn how to learn.

01:06.460 --> 01:12.510
Don't just watch videos blindly at two times the speed and expect to learn everything.

01:12.550 --> 01:20.740
Find the most efficient way that works for you and keep practicing by learning to learn.

01:20.810 --> 01:24.370
You become a better developer as developers.

01:24.380 --> 01:32.210
We have to constantly learn throughout our career our learning never stops because technology is constantly

01:32.210 --> 01:33.230
evolving.

01:33.230 --> 01:42.580
So if you want to be a successful developer you have to learn your best learning style.

01:42.770 --> 01:48.290
It is better to figure out what makes you tick what makes things clearer for you now then later on in

01:48.290 --> 01:49.240
your career.

01:49.430 --> 01:50.480
Start early.

01:50.480 --> 01:56.420
Figure out what is the best method for you because it's going to be a skill that you're going to use

01:56.570 --> 01:57.440
throughout your career.
