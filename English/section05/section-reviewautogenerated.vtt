00:01.240 --> 00:02.700
There we have it.

00:02.740 --> 00:06.400
We went over a professional python developer setup.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.690
Now you must be asking yourself.

00:08.860 --> 00:10.380
There's so many things I want to do.

00:10.390 --> 00:15.240
I want to optimize my code editors my terminal to have a certain look and feel.

00:15.340 --> 00:16.780
I want to have different extensions.

00:16.780 --> 00:23.540
There's so many extensions and plug ins that you can take but the beauty is that what you want and what

00:23.540 --> 00:32.180
you like evolves over time and you'll have to customize your terminal or command prompt to different

00:32.180 --> 00:38.210
ways different color schemes having different tools available to you you might prefer the lightness

00:38.210 --> 00:44.730
of code editors and keep things simple without having all that weight of something like an idea pie

00:44.780 --> 00:45.120
chart.

00:45.130 --> 00:47.940
That takes a bit of time to get used to.

00:47.960 --> 00:52.400
That's why I personally like Sublime Text nice really lightweight.

00:52.400 --> 01:00.380
And whenever I need a plug in our extension I can install it and just use that or you might prefer using

01:00.380 --> 01:07.310
Jupiter notebooks because it's a really great way to stay organized take notes and also run your small

01:07.310 --> 01:14.020
little code snippets multiple code snippets in different cells what you pick is up to you.

01:14.060 --> 01:19.700
My job was to show you the tools that are available and the tools that are being used by professional

01:19.940 --> 01:21.170
developers.

01:21.170 --> 01:22.520
But everybody's different.

01:22.520 --> 01:28.890
There's no right way no right tool that is better than all the rest.

01:29.640 --> 01:38.070
So what I recommend is have your terminal or command prompt or partial set up properly to your liking

01:38.760 --> 01:42.340
and make sure that you get Jupiter notebooks.

01:42.540 --> 01:48.390
But when it comes to code editors or ideas just pick one one that you like maybe even try Spider if

01:48.390 --> 01:55.740
you want and stick with that because as you spend more time coding in one environment you'll get better

01:55.740 --> 01:57.800
and better and more used to it.

01:57.810 --> 02:04.440
So as a final anglicized for this section pick one of these code editors or ideas and customize it to

02:04.440 --> 02:05.120
your liking.

02:05.280 --> 02:07.680
Make it just right.

02:07.740 --> 02:15.090
And once you do that trust me it's like every time you code you enter your home with all your favorite

02:15.330 --> 02:17.900
tools for insurers and things.

02:17.970 --> 02:19.410
I'll see in the next one.

02:19.430 --> 02:19.760
Bye bye.
