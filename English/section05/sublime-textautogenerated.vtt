00:00.450 --> 00:04.110
Let's install Sun developer tools first one.

00:04.110 --> 00:06.960
And personally this is my favorite code.

00:07.170 --> 00:14.340
It's sublime text you can download based on whatever operating system you have.

00:14.340 --> 00:23.070
In my case it's a mac so it's OSX so I'll simply click on here and just open this up and it's going

00:23.070 --> 00:24.900
to install sublime text for me.

00:25.110 --> 00:34.950
Now Sublime Text has this model where it is free but every time you save maybe like every 20th time

00:34.950 --> 00:41.850
that you save Oh have a prompt says hey you should purchase Sublime Text so if you really really like

00:41.850 --> 00:47.490
it it's good to contribute and actually buy it and most of the time the workplace that you work at will

00:47.670 --> 00:50.930
actually cover the cost but you can also use it for free.

00:50.930 --> 00:56.010
You'll just get that annoying prompt every once in a while when you save saying hey buy but you can

00:56.010 --> 01:00.020
still have all the features that you want with the free version in my Mac.

01:00.030 --> 01:07.260
I'm going to drag it into applications and while I already have Sublime Text actually installed so I'm

01:07.260 --> 01:10.830
just going to say stop because well it's already installed.

01:11.450 --> 01:16.640
All right so that's Sublime Text and once we open it up

01:20.910 --> 01:23.010
it'll look something like this.

01:23.620 --> 01:33.400
It's a code editor that allows me to write just like a war document but it has this ability to format

01:33.430 --> 01:38.340
my code and make my code look better when I'm actually coding.

01:38.350 --> 01:45.400
If I go down to the bottom here and click you see that we have different languages that we can use in

01:45.400 --> 01:54.620
my case I want to use Python so that now if I do print look at that I have some color completion it

01:54.620 --> 02:01.730
gives me some hints and lets say I make a mistake here while there you go I get some highlighting saying

02:01.730 --> 02:04.430
hey matching bracket cannot be found.

02:04.430 --> 02:09.810
Make sure that you close this out so immediately you can see the usefulness of this.

02:09.860 --> 02:17.480
It tells me as I'm coding along what errors I'm making it makes the call pretty and generally is just

02:17.480 --> 02:22.080
a better experience to quote now with sublime texts.

02:22.090 --> 02:25.740
This python is actually version 2 of Python.

02:25.960 --> 02:35.320
So if I remove the brackets it doesn't give me an error because Python 2 while this is valid syntax

02:36.240 --> 02:43.600
so in order to upgrade this to Python 3 we have to install a few packages on a Mac.

02:43.620 --> 02:52.530
It's command shift P and you'll get this drop down menu on Windows L.B. control shift b but you can

02:52.530 --> 03:00.280
also just do it this way by hitting tools and just hitting command pallet and here we're going to say

03:00.280 --> 03:06.860
install packages and for installing packages we're gonna say Python 3

03:09.750 --> 03:13.490
and there's lots of packages that you can install to customize it.

03:13.500 --> 03:17.660
And there's tons of resources online of customizing your code editor.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.760
So everybody has their own preference.

03:21.110 --> 03:26.750
Now if I click over here I see that I now have Python 3 and if I click here.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.170
All right.

03:27.170 --> 03:28.830
Everything is good.

03:29.910 --> 03:34.530
And now we can just save this file we can call it.

03:34.720 --> 03:35.470
Hi Dad.

03:35.470 --> 03:38.050
Pie on our desktop.

03:38.050 --> 03:43.030
And when we save this sometimes and this will switch over to python.

03:43.030 --> 03:45.730
Now this shouldn't matter too much.

03:45.730 --> 03:55.760
We could also do tools command pallet and just set syntax with Python 3 and another interesting thing

03:55.760 --> 04:02.930
we can do is if we go to the command pallet once again I can say build with Python 3.

04:03.220 --> 04:12.190
When I click that look at that it's going to run this file for me and it's going to say whoa whoa whoa.

04:12.230 --> 04:17.580
There is an issue on line one says missing parentheses and call to print.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.290
Did you mean print Hello.

04:19.390 --> 04:26.250
How nice is that so we get to fix our errors.

04:26.310 --> 04:33.440
And now if we do command pallet or if you're on a Mac you do command shift P as you can see here or

04:33.450 --> 04:36.060
control shift B if you're on Windows.

04:36.300 --> 04:42.080
I can just say Bill with Python 3 and now look at that.

04:42.360 --> 04:48.590
Everything is running smoothly and it prints hello.

04:48.680 --> 04:52.280
For now we have a basic setup for Sublime Text.

04:52.280 --> 04:57.710
We can do a lot of things and you can google of how you might want to customize Sublime Text maybe you

04:57.710 --> 05:03.350
want to change some colors so you go to color schemes and maybe I don't know.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.690
Let's change it to Mariana and look at that.

05:05.690 --> 05:07.220
It looks pretty good.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.710
So lots of options here.

05:09.740 --> 05:17.150
This is one of my favorite code editors but I recommend finding your own testing different things out

05:17.150 --> 05:19.160
and finding why you like.

05:19.160 --> 05:26.660
Usually though the tool like a code editor doesn't make the programmer you just want to get comfortable

05:26.660 --> 05:27.650
with one of them.

05:27.740 --> 05:31.440
And from there you'll just write good code.

05:31.730 --> 05:37.250
So don't spend too much time customizing and making perfect because to me personally that's just a waste

05:37.250 --> 05:37.910
of time.

05:38.120 --> 05:46.040
Your time is better spent learning to code actually coding instead of finding just the best color scheme

05:46.040 --> 05:47.110
to have on your code.

05:47.120 --> 05:47.450
Ed.
