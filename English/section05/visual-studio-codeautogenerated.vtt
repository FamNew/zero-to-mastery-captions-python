WEBVTT

00:00.820 --> 00:01.870
Welcome back.

00:01.870 --> 00:07.490
The next code editor we're gonna look at is a very very popular one.

00:07.600 --> 00:10.220
It's completely free.

00:10.250 --> 00:16.860
So I think right now it's probably the most popular code editor out there in the community.

00:17.180 --> 00:23.900
And I think you'll see why we can download it based on your machine so you can pick whatever computer

00:23.900 --> 00:24.620
you have.

00:24.620 --> 00:29.290
In my case we'll download it for Mac and it has a really really good get started.

00:29.290 --> 00:34.580
Guy again all these tools have a lot of information online for them.

00:34.610 --> 00:41.530
So again if you get stuck with downloads there's always a way for you to figure out how to solve these.

00:41.540 --> 00:49.760
Now keep in mind with code editors it doesn't just mean these are for Python both Sublime Text and Visual

00:49.760 --> 00:55.880
Studio code can write any sort of language programming language that you want.

00:55.880 --> 01:04.310
Like myself I usually like writing javascript as well so I can go back and forth between different languages

01:04.400 --> 01:06.580
but still use the same tools.

01:06.650 --> 01:09.680
So let's open up this code.

01:09.680 --> 01:15.290
We're going to install this and again on Windows will be very similar you'll go through an installer

01:16.220 --> 01:24.350
my case I'll add it to my applications my case it should appear somewhere around here click on that.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.740
And there you go.

01:25.770 --> 01:28.280
We have visual studio code.

01:28.590 --> 01:31.650
There's a lot more going on than sublime text.

01:31.650 --> 01:37.530
It's why I actually prefer Sublime Text there's just the less things happening on the screen but you

01:37.530 --> 01:42.240
can see over here that has some really nice features.

01:42.240 --> 01:48.240
For example we can create a new file here and we can just create let's say python file.

01:48.720 --> 01:56.850
So I'm going to command s and safe and just call it Hello Dot pie because we want to create a python

01:56.850 --> 02:05.040
file you'll see right away when I do that it's going to tell me Hey there's no Python interpreter selected

02:05.400 --> 02:07.440
you need to select a python interpreter.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.480
And luckily we actually learned what that means right.

02:10.500 --> 02:15.050
So let's select a python interpreter and look at that.

02:15.300 --> 02:22.020
It tells me that I have a choice because we've downloaded version three point seven but on my Mac I

02:22.020 --> 02:24.840
also have the pre installed two point seven.

02:24.840 --> 02:28.410
So luckily Visual Studio code tells me hey which one do you want to use.

02:28.420 --> 02:32.880
And I'm going to say I want to use Python three.

02:32.890 --> 02:40.670
There you go and I get another hint it says hey we also have a litter available for python.

02:40.710 --> 02:43.140
Do you want to install that extension as well.

02:43.140 --> 02:44.600
We'll get to that in a bit.

02:44.730 --> 02:46.380
But for now let's focus on this.

02:46.470 --> 02:49.490
If I do print Hello.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.190
Getting really creative with my code here.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.800
You see that again.

02:53.810 --> 02:56.710
I have syntax highlighting everything looks good.

02:56.780 --> 02:59.600
If I miss a bracket what happens.

02:59.600 --> 03:00.950
Do I get in years.

03:00.950 --> 03:09.060
What if I just write some gibberish here I'm not getting anything because well I don't have this pilot

03:09.210 --> 03:18.550
installed but again we'll get to lynching in a bit the cool thing about Visual Studio code is that you

03:18.550 --> 03:21.940
also have the terminal right here.

03:22.080 --> 03:30.230
You can actually if this isn't open for you you can just click terminal and just say new terminal now

03:30.290 --> 03:38.440
in here I'm going to close this for now I can run my Python code and let's make sure it is just a print

03:40.090 --> 03:44.790
I can say Python Hello Dot pi.

03:45.020 --> 03:47.040
I click Run.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.770
I didn't save this I'll make sure I save it.

03:48.780 --> 04:02.210
So it's the new version and run this again Python Hello your PI look at that it's all working now up

04:02.210 --> 04:02.830
to this point.

04:02.870 --> 04:05.370
We have this print Hello.

04:05.510 --> 04:09.680
We also know that we're running Python version three point seven.

04:09.680 --> 04:18.070
You can see here if I click on here I can select what interpreter I want to use and it also gives us

04:18.220 --> 04:27.100
a few tips such as Hey Lynch your pilot is not installed so let's install pilot pilot is a.

04:27.100 --> 04:34.760
That is it's almost as a spell checker for our code and letting us know is this syntax right.

04:34.840 --> 04:39.440
And there are many versions of winters available for Python pilot.

04:39.490 --> 04:45.830
Just happens to be one of the most popular and yes code by default suggests pilot.

04:45.850 --> 04:54.180
So let's install that once that's installed you see over here that everything is going through and now

04:54.210 --> 04:55.680
let's see if this works.

04:55.770 --> 04:57.450
So let's save this file.

04:57.450 --> 04:59.790
I'm going to say file save.

04:59.880 --> 05:02.340
And if I click on problems here.

05:03.330 --> 05:09.790
There are no problems detected so far but we know that the print should have brackets around it.

05:09.810 --> 05:20.940
So what we want to do here is go to view command pallet and we see right away that it says Python enabled

05:21.110 --> 05:21.750
lending.

05:21.840 --> 05:29.280
If I type Python here the python installer that we had at the beginning when we installed V.S. code

05:29.790 --> 05:36.270
installed a whole bunch of shortcuts and tools for us to use such as enable lending.

05:36.270 --> 05:40.140
So let's click on that and I'm going to say.

05:40.730 --> 05:47.540
If I save look at that in my problems it says missing parentheses and call to print.

05:47.540 --> 05:48.640
Did you meet.

05:48.740 --> 05:49.610
Did you mean print.

05:49.610 --> 05:50.740
Hello.

05:50.750 --> 05:57.470
I also get this little underline and it tells me exactly a what print does but also telling me what

05:57.470 --> 05:59.270
errors I need to fix.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.360
And you see that it's a pilot syntax error.

06:02.450 --> 06:04.870
So again I can just fix that.

06:05.030 --> 06:06.680
Nice and easy.

06:06.700 --> 06:10.800
Now if I save there's no problems everything is running fine.

06:10.880 --> 06:18.120
If I go to my terminal and do Python Hello Dot pie look at that.

06:18.120 --> 06:25.170
Everything is working nicely so this problem's panel is really nice for your code to be told hey something's

06:25.170 --> 06:25.430
wrong.

06:25.430 --> 06:32.370
For example if I miss a bracket here and I save the problems is going to tell me Hey hey there's something

06:32.370 --> 06:38.340
going on there's a syntax error and pilot is helping me solve that issue.

06:39.280 --> 06:46.640
By the way you might be asking yourself how come my editor Vasco doesn't look like this.

06:46.730 --> 06:55.860
For example if I go to extensions I have the Dracula official theme enable now which is a color theme

06:55.890 --> 07:03.230
that I have for Visual Studio code and let's click on this over here and just and just say disable all

07:03.230 --> 07:10.100
installed extensions you'll see that I just have a few extensions that allow my visual studio code to

07:10.100 --> 07:11.180
be customized.

07:11.180 --> 07:16.270
But in your case if you're just installing Visual Studio code it'll look something like this.

07:16.400 --> 07:23.830
But by installing the python package with the pilot we now have a fully abled idea.

07:23.840 --> 07:28.010
In a sense for us to write Python code I'll see in the next one.

07:28.560 --> 07:28.760
Bob.
