00:00.390 --> 00:01.590
Welcome back.

00:01.590 --> 00:06.400
Up until now we've talked about Sublime Text and Visual Studio code.

00:06.600 --> 00:13.590
Code editors that we had to install a bunch of plugins and extensions in order to customize it to what

00:13.590 --> 00:21.200
we want and they work really well with a ton of different programming languages the next one though

00:21.500 --> 00:30.050
is an I.D. e and it's called pie chart and it's probably the most popular tool for Python developers.

00:30.050 --> 00:38.600
So I really really like it but it's an IDC that is unlike a code editor it already comes pre-built with

00:38.630 --> 00:40.260
a lot of things.

00:40.340 --> 00:45.870
This company Jeff brains makes it and the focus purely on Python developers.

00:46.070 --> 00:52.640
So that is if you're a python developer they really focus and make sure that all the tools you need

00:52.640 --> 00:54.710
to succeed are in here.

00:55.580 --> 01:03.470
Now when you click on Download Now you have two versions the professional one which you have to pay

01:03.470 --> 01:05.720
for and the community one.

01:05.810 --> 01:11.750
So just download the community one the professional One just comes with a few extra features that we

01:11.750 --> 01:12.600
don't really need.

01:12.620 --> 01:15.000
So download the community one.

01:15.050 --> 01:16.160
Just a heads up.

01:16.190 --> 01:17.810
It's a lot bigger.

01:17.810 --> 01:19.940
It's three hundred and fifteen megabytes.

01:19.940 --> 01:23.370
So again it comes with a lot more tools for us to use.

01:23.390 --> 01:28.180
So it is a little bit heavier than Visual Studio code or Sublime Text.

01:28.790 --> 01:34.280
But if you are a python developer and you just want an environment where you can do everything in one

01:34.280 --> 01:37.810
place pi charm is the way to go.

01:37.820 --> 01:42.650
Now let's fast forward through this so that we're not waiting around for the download.

01:42.890 --> 01:43.640
All right.

01:43.640 --> 01:48.070
That was a long pause for me but for you with some editing this should have been quick.

01:48.190 --> 01:48.890
Right.

01:48.920 --> 01:56.450
If I open this up now again if you're on Windows or if you're on Mac installation process will be different

01:56.930 --> 01:59.440
in our case because we are on a Mac.

01:59.540 --> 02:06.900
I just drag this to application with Windows you'll probably go through an installer all right it's

02:06.930 --> 02:07.890
all installed.

02:07.980 --> 02:20.020
Now if I double click py charm is going to open up for me and we'll just make sure we allow it now in

02:20.020 --> 02:28.600
my case I had already a previous version of picture that I've been using and you might want to import

02:28.630 --> 02:29.590
your previous setting.

02:29.770 --> 02:32.680
But in our case we've never used pie chart before.

02:32.680 --> 02:39.160
And also most likely you want a fresh install so even if you get this type of pop up you can just click

02:39.160 --> 02:43.190
on do not import settings so you get a fresh slate.

02:43.260 --> 02:46.540
We're going to click okay and there we have it.

02:47.280 --> 02:50.040
And right away you can see that.

02:50.190 --> 02:51.960
Well it gives us a lot of options.

02:52.530 --> 02:54.570
Let's just say I've never used pie chart before.

02:54.570 --> 02:57.020
And next we get to choose our UI.

02:57.030 --> 02:59.490
Do we want Dracula which is dark.

02:59.490 --> 03:00.710
Or do we want light.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.070
Let's go with dark for now

03:05.120 --> 03:08.240
so I'm going to skip the remaining and set default

03:13.020 --> 03:18.300
so in PI charm now we can create a new project.

03:18.450 --> 03:22.110
Now in here it asks us where we want our create our project.

03:22.110 --> 03:24.430
In my case we can just leave it over here.

03:24.480 --> 03:33.120
We'll call it my project and before we click Create make sure that you click on this project.

03:33.140 --> 03:42.480
Interpreter and double check that our base interpreter is using Python 3.

03:42.530 --> 03:49.550
Remember if you're on a Mac or Linux you might have Python 2 already installed in our case we installed

03:49.610 --> 03:52.900
our python version three point seven right here.

03:52.910 --> 03:59.880
So we make sure that this latest version of Python is what's being used as the interpreter.

03:59.930 --> 04:05.110
Now we can just click Create and our project is going to start for us

04:08.730 --> 04:15.130
we enclose these tips every once in a while you get tip of the day because this is an idea you get a

04:15.130 --> 04:19.660
lot of features that you can read about online.

04:19.660 --> 04:27.800
So it might take you a while to get used to pie chart but it is a very powerful tool let's make this

04:27.800 --> 04:29.170
a little bit bigger.

04:29.330 --> 04:38.660
Now with my project here I can right click say new and then select file our file we'll just call it.

04:39.130 --> 04:39.370
Hi.

04:39.370 --> 04:43.000
Hi dot pie click Okay.

04:44.700 --> 04:45.580
And there we go.

04:45.580 --> 04:51.850
We have our first file opened up and we can just once again say print.

04:51.910 --> 04:57.480
Now this is definitely way too small so I'm going to go to pie chart preferences.

04:57.520 --> 05:02.540
And here it gives you a ton of options to customize pi charm to your liking.

05:02.560 --> 05:09.000
In my case I want to make sure that I use let's say a custom font but definitely increase the size too.

05:09.030 --> 05:10.250
Let's go with 18.

05:10.270 --> 05:10.990
How's that.

05:10.990 --> 05:13.510
Let's apply that's better.

05:13.510 --> 05:14.560
You know what I want to.

05:14.560 --> 05:15.700
Even bigger.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.530
Let's do 20.

05:17.530 --> 05:18.130
I'm going to head.

05:18.150 --> 05:20.710
OK.

05:20.790 --> 05:21.120
All right.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.220
This side is now bigger.

05:23.220 --> 05:23.760
That's great.

05:23.760 --> 05:27.510
We can see it but this is still tiny.

05:27.510 --> 05:30.410
I want this a little bit bigger so let's fix that as well.

05:30.540 --> 05:38.910
We can fix this easily by pressing command and then using the mouse wheel if you have a mouse or using

05:38.910 --> 05:47.310
two fingers and zooming in like so if you're on a Windows machine L.B. control instead of command and

05:47.310 --> 05:51.380
just zooming in and out as you like.

05:51.390 --> 05:53.960
Now the interesting thing here with pie chart.

05:54.210 --> 06:01.500
I know we have a ton of things that we might not be familiar with right now but the key thing is that

06:01.500 --> 06:10.830
Python three point seven is running our project and if we type something like print Hey hey we get a

06:10.830 --> 06:21.450
ton of interesting things first we get a typo saying hey this whole hey hey is not an English word.

06:21.450 --> 06:23.450
If I add spaces look at that.

06:23.490 --> 06:31.500
It even gives me typos of English words but then I also have this yellow curly bracket or squiggly line

06:32.690 --> 06:37.610
and it tells me Pep 8 no new line at the end of the file there's something that we're going to talk

06:37.610 --> 06:41.100
about shortly when we talk about formatting our code.

06:41.330 --> 06:43.880
But if I add a new line look at that.

06:44.030 --> 06:46.050
Everything is working smoothly.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.940
I get a nice little checkmark.

06:48.380 --> 06:57.600
Now I can run this code by going to run and then clicking run and you can see the shortcut command here

06:57.600 --> 06:58.440
as well.

06:58.440 --> 07:01.560
If I run this asked me Hey what do you want to run.

07:01.740 --> 07:05.050
Well I want to run the new high high python file.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.990
I click on this and look at that.

07:08.030 --> 07:10.920
Let's make this a little bit bigger that's better.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.980
We see that our file is being run.

07:15.220 --> 07:20.620
The process finished with exit code 0 0 is a good sign it means there were no errors and everything

07:20.860 --> 07:28.510
is great now we who make an error here and let's say I miss my brackets and I hit run arc and just click

07:28.510 --> 07:37.450
on run here look at that it gives me an error saying hey hey syntax error and expected yo f while passing

07:37.950 --> 07:39.650
and tells you something went wrong.

07:39.820 --> 07:45.360
So once again I can fix it run my code and everything is good.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.960
There are a lot of features here that you can explore on your own.

07:49.030 --> 07:50.330
Get comfortable with it.

07:50.500 --> 07:53.560
Pie charm is definitely a great idea.

07:53.590 --> 08:00.190
And the beauty is that unlike Sublime Text or visual studio code where we had to install all these packages

08:00.580 --> 08:04.900
pie chart comes well with everything built in.

08:04.900 --> 08:09.290
It's an IDC we don't have to install any of these packages.

08:09.400 --> 08:15.460
This environment is already set up for us to work professionally with python because it is made for

08:15.460 --> 08:17.280
Python developers.

08:17.440 --> 08:18.990
I'll see in the next one by.
