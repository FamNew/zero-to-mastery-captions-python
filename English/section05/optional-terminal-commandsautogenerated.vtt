00:01.730 --> 00:07.540
A big part of being a developer is being able to use the terminal or the command line.

00:07.550 --> 00:09.310
Well what is it.

00:09.560 --> 00:14.470
In this video we're going to tackle this question and teach you a couple of very useful comments.

00:14.630 --> 00:20.750
Now on a Mac you simply do command space and type in terminal press enter and then the terminal will

00:20.750 --> 00:21.470
open for you.

00:21.470 --> 00:24.560
It's one of your applications and it's on every computer.

00:24.560 --> 00:29.300
If you're on a Windows machine then it is the command prompt.

00:29.300 --> 00:32.010
But what is it.

00:32.010 --> 00:37.970
Well it's how humans originally communicated with computers up until the 1980s.

00:38.070 --> 00:44.570
It was the main way humans gave instructions to computers and computers gave output to the humans.

00:44.610 --> 00:50.970
We didn't have something called the gooey or the graphical user interface such as me opening up a new

00:50.970 --> 00:56.550
folder and changing the name of this folder or opening up Google Chrome.

00:56.550 --> 01:00.000
I don't really need to know how this is done behind the scenes.

01:00.120 --> 01:06.360
I just click on an icon and it opens it up magically for me but command lines are really useful because

01:06.810 --> 01:12.990
you can do the exact same thing that you do visually on a graphical user interface like I have here

01:13.650 --> 01:14.770
on the command line.

01:15.030 --> 01:19.180
But they tend to be much much faster to do as I'm going to show you in this video.

01:19.290 --> 01:24.900
And they're also common ways to access different computers around the world like if you need to access

01:24.900 --> 01:28.360
a server in another country where your web app is hosted.

01:28.380 --> 01:34.310
Well you you'd use the command line and I'll show you how to do that later on in the course now in your

01:34.310 --> 01:35.110
day to day job.

01:35.120 --> 01:41.450
You'll be using at the terminal a lot because you'll have to access servers the database your front

01:41.450 --> 01:45.410
end application but you can do all that in one from the terminal.

01:45.470 --> 01:50.930
You can also download scripts that other people have written from the internet so you can use in your

01:50.930 --> 01:52.150
projects.

01:52.190 --> 01:55.890
Now these are all things I'm going to show you in the later sections.

01:56.180 --> 02:01.160
The commands that I'm about to show you work on a Mac or a Linux for Windows.

02:01.160 --> 02:05.720
I'll have the Windows version command at the bottom of the video as we progress.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.520
Most of them are the same but there are a few differences.

02:08.870 --> 02:14.550
So let's get started the first comment I'm going to show you is the LSI comment.

02:14.930 --> 02:22.190
I simply type in and press enter and it lists everything that is in my current directory.

02:22.460 --> 02:24.080
What is my current directory.

02:24.080 --> 02:31.910
Well I do p WD for present working directory and I see that I'm in the users.

02:32.150 --> 02:33.160
That's my user name.

02:33.230 --> 02:41.270
So I'm in my username folder and these are all the things available to me if I do C D then I can go

02:41.270 --> 02:51.260
into this if I wanted to go to let's say desktop I do C D desktop and now if I do less I see that I

02:51.260 --> 02:54.640
have untitled folder because that's the only thing on my desktop right now.

02:56.240 --> 03:08.760
I can also do C D dot dot and this brings me back to one directory up I can also do clear to clear up

03:08.760 --> 03:18.430
my terminal and have a nice fresh slate there's a stroke command C.D. slash and this takes me to the

03:18.430 --> 03:25.780
root directory if I do else I see that I have applications library system users that's the root directory

03:25.780 --> 03:39.290
of my Mac essentially my Macintosh HD I can also do C.D. squiggly line and this takes me to the user

03:39.470 --> 03:44.980
directory let's clear this again and if we check where we are.

03:45.050 --> 03:52.890
All right let's change just untitled folder to something like test ok let's say I'm in the user directory

03:52.890 --> 03:59.790
right now I wanted to access desktop and then the test folder I would simply do C.D. desktop and then

04:00.120 --> 04:07.810
test and now I'm in the test full there but there's nothing in there.

04:07.810 --> 04:16.930
So one thing we can do is I can say open dot and it opens a folder that we're currently in OK we're

04:16.940 --> 04:25.650
in the test folder now if I just put this to the side of here so you can see I can say make directory

04:26.520 --> 04:34.590
which is make a folder name so name here will be whatever I want the folder to be titled Let's just

04:34.590 --> 04:36.390
say this folder would be called

04:39.580 --> 04:40.910
did you see that.

04:40.910 --> 04:47.040
Now web app shows up in my folder let's change of view here so you can see it better.

04:47.060 --> 04:48.100
There you go.

04:48.100 --> 04:56.470
If I do LSD now I see that we have the web app folder and as we know we can go into it and let's double

04:56.470 --> 04:57.640
click here to see what we have.

04:57.640 --> 05:00.830
We have absolutely nothing.

05:00.950 --> 05:06.670
Well we can create a file in here by saying touch and the name of the file.

05:06.680 --> 05:10.340
So let's just do index dot HDMI amount.

05:10.490 --> 05:12.910
There you go and X that cinema.

05:13.130 --> 05:16.650
Now what if we wanted to open this index that Asian all.

05:16.660 --> 05:23.610
Again we just do open and the dot means we open the folder we're currently in which is here.

05:23.720 --> 05:30.190
But if I do open index dot HDMI l it opens the file for us.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.020
How cool is that.

05:31.350 --> 05:37.830
But index that HMO is pretty empty right now wouldn't be nice if we can open Sublime Text from here

05:37.860 --> 05:42.100
and add something again he can do that with open.

05:42.580 --> 05:51.820
You put in a line a for application and the name of the application so sublime text close the double

05:51.820 --> 05:55.490
quotes press enter and look at that.

05:55.490 --> 06:05.070
I have Sublime Text but if we wanted to do application sublime texts and open the index that a shemale

06:05.090 --> 06:20.810
file would just do this and now I can say AML and we'll just say hello world save that and if I do open

06:20.820 --> 06:27.120
index start HRT mouth we have our index that Asian male file loaded.

06:27.340 --> 06:33.970
Wasn't that a lot faster than right clicking creating a folder then dragging everything to sublime tax.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.760
And as you can see you can do things really really fast here.

06:37.620 --> 06:37.930
OK.

06:37.970 --> 06:38.890
Let's change something.

06:38.950 --> 06:39.250
Let's.

06:39.250 --> 06:45.940
I'm going to close Google Chrome and sublime and in the web app lets say I wanted to change the name

06:45.940 --> 06:49.210
of index that a simple to above the HMO.

06:49.240 --> 06:56.440
Well I'll do the end the command which stands for move but it just moves the index that Asia mail file

06:56.680 --> 06:59.300
to about that issue mail file.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.490
So it's a little trick.

07:00.490 --> 07:07.990
You're essentially just moving one file to another but by changing the name you create a new file and

07:07.990 --> 07:09.730
you replace it with the old one.

07:10.840 --> 07:16.220
So now I have about Dot HMO very cool.

07:16.370 --> 07:18.880
Now these commands typing them can get pretty tiring.

07:18.890 --> 07:24.980
I can press the up arrow and it goes through my entire history which is very cool.

07:25.000 --> 07:32.440
I can also press the tap key and it will bring up my most recent command or complete.

07:32.440 --> 07:35.680
So what I'm about to write so you can do it really really fast.

07:35.680 --> 07:40.780
And when your commands get longer and longer it's a very useful thing to do.

07:40.810 --> 07:44.110
I don't really need the about HCM I'll file anymore.

07:44.110 --> 07:45.380
Let's remove it.

07:45.400 --> 07:56.360
We do our M for a move and the name of the file about groups about that patient AML it's been removed.

07:56.360 --> 07:57.260
Perfect.

07:57.260 --> 08:01.370
Now what about the way that file.

08:01.370 --> 08:02.500
We can remove that as well.

08:02.510 --> 08:05.270
But if I just do remove web app

08:08.640 --> 08:09.850
it's not going to work.

08:09.870 --> 08:16.980
First of all if I do l s or present working directory I mean the web app folder.

08:16.980 --> 08:20.320
So I need to move back to the test folder.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.040
Let's clear here.

08:22.120 --> 08:30.590
Do C.D. now my present working directory is I'm in the test so I can remove web app by doing remove

08:31.460 --> 08:41.920
web app but our m only works for files to remove a directory a folder you need to do R.M. and then use

08:41.920 --> 08:47.970
the r option and then the folder name in the our case has the web app.

08:48.040 --> 08:48.840
There you go.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.080
It's gone.

08:50.080 --> 08:53.800
And with that you know we can remove the test folder as well.

08:53.800 --> 09:01.380
We can go back to our desktop and then do remove our test.

09:01.590 --> 09:02.230
There you go.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.220
It's gone.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.180
And one last trick on a Mac.

09:06.190 --> 09:12.060
You can do this.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.790
This is so cool.

09:14.090 --> 09:14.880
Right.

09:14.900 --> 09:17.380
Very very cool OK.

09:17.460 --> 09:23.130
As you can see you can have a lot of power with the terminal and I want you to get used to writing commands

09:23.130 --> 09:23.730
on here.

09:23.730 --> 09:28.290
And from now on try creating files and folders this way.

09:28.290 --> 09:33.720
Eventually you will get more and more comfortable with it and things will be much faster than just using

09:33.870 --> 09:37.150
the gooey and the developer environment section.

09:37.380 --> 09:48.380
I'll show you how you can change this boring black and white terminal to something like this.

09:48.380 --> 09:52.740
That's it for now.

09:52.740 --> 09:54.650
See you in the next venue.

09:54.920 --> 09:55.530
But by.
