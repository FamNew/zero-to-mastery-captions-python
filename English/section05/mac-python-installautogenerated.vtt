WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:04.520
It's happening after all the suspense all my talking.

00:04.800 --> 00:05.240
Yes.

00:05.250 --> 00:05.740
Yes.

00:05.760 --> 00:11.510
We're finally going to download python on our machines now.

00:11.610 --> 00:18.540
Based on what device you're using the installation may change but I'll provide videos for each one of

00:18.540 --> 00:23.670
the operating systems so I'm on a Mac right now.

00:23.740 --> 00:32.170
And if you're using a Mac or a Linux distribution you might have Python already installed on your machine.

00:32.170 --> 00:32.710
What do I mean.

00:33.580 --> 00:37.450
Well if you open something called your terminal.

00:37.450 --> 00:49.650
So if I'm on my Mac and do command space and I type in terminal press center well right over here if

00:49.650 --> 01:01.810
I type in Python and press enter you see that I enter something called a ripple or a read Val print

01:01.810 --> 01:07.000
loop where I can type Python commands like print

01:11.590 --> 01:21.050
and look at that it's working just like we had our reptile browser or Web site I can type Python here

01:21.500 --> 01:28.250
and most Macs come pre installed with Python but you might notice something here.

01:28.250 --> 01:33.720
Yep we're using python version to two point seven to be specific.

01:33.770 --> 01:37.370
Now as we've talked about that is an older version of Python.

01:37.370 --> 01:40.370
Ideally we want to install Python 3.

01:40.550 --> 01:47.570
So we're gonna need to go to Python dot org and install the latest version of Python which is three

01:47.630 --> 01:48.980
point seven.

01:48.980 --> 01:54.830
By the time you watch this video there might be a higher version maybe three point eight three point

01:54.830 --> 01:55.780
nine.

01:55.820 --> 02:03.090
Now like I said a language is always evolving but what I'm going to teach you in this course is going

02:03.090 --> 02:10.020
to work for any future versions of python so it doesn't matter if the numbers is a little bit off as

02:10.020 --> 02:13.890
long as you're installing python version 3 or up.

02:13.890 --> 02:15.360
You should be all good to go.

02:15.510 --> 02:23.070
In our case we're on a mac so we're going to just click install and you can see over here that the package

02:23.130 --> 02:24.810
is being installed.

02:24.930 --> 02:32.980
I'm going to open it up and just simply run through the commands one to install click through.

02:33.000 --> 02:33.660
Continue.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.930
Yes I agree to the license.

02:35.940 --> 02:38.130
I definitely read all that.

02:38.160 --> 02:46.530
Yes let's agree and we're going to just continue and install Python if you want to hide your password

02:46.590 --> 02:47.740
or your fingerprint.

02:47.880 --> 02:49.560
That works too.

02:49.560 --> 02:54.500
And you see that we're finally installing our Python interpreter.

02:54.610 --> 02:55.290
All right.

02:55.290 --> 02:56.190
There it is.

02:56.190 --> 03:00.360
We have Python three point seven installed.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.270
Now if everything worked as planned.

03:03.270 --> 03:14.140
If I go back to my terminal and I type Python you'll see that you have python version three point seven

03:14.140 --> 03:16.580
or version three or higher.

03:16.670 --> 03:17.520
That's good.

03:17.540 --> 03:18.730
No more Python 2.

03:18.890 --> 03:22.090
Now depending on your machine.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.600
Again this is why installations can get tricky.

03:24.650 --> 03:31.280
You might actually not have this work for example in order to exit out of here we'll say exit and then

03:31.400 --> 03:41.700
curly brackets you might have to type Python 3 and you'll see that you might have to specify exactly

03:41.700 --> 03:46.410
the version because if you just do Python it'll be a version too.

03:46.440 --> 03:53.490
Now if you encounter any problems installing python on your machine I will provide resources that you

03:53.490 --> 04:00.210
can see attached to this video or you can ask questions in our disk or channel or our Q and A form but

04:00.330 --> 04:07.350
it looks like we finally have our Python 3 installation on our computer remember we just installed our

04:07.350 --> 04:17.720
interpreter and our virtual machine our C Python VM in order to write Python and then evaluate that

04:17.720 --> 04:19.840
python code.

04:19.850 --> 04:20.540
Good job.

04:20.540 --> 04:23.100
Let's take a break and I'll see you in the next video Bye.
