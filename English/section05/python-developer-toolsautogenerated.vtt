00:00.830 --> 00:01.840
Welcome back.

00:01.850 --> 00:07.880
Remember this slide I told you that we're going to wait until we set up our developer environment.

00:07.970 --> 00:13.170
And up until now we've been using a browser to run our Python code.

00:13.340 --> 00:20.360
But we want to be professional developers and professional developers use professional tools in our

00:20.360 --> 00:21.050
case.

00:21.080 --> 00:24.220
These are the main ones in the Python community.

00:24.290 --> 00:28.190
Right now we have the terminal or command prompt.

00:28.190 --> 00:37.970
If you're on Windows to run quick python scripts and we've seen this before I can go into my terminal

00:38.630 --> 00:42.760
type in Python or Python 3.

00:42.770 --> 00:48.890
Make sure that we have that version and then in here I can just write any python script that I want

00:51.560 --> 00:58.270
I enter it and I just run these simple scripts and I can just exit like this.

00:58.300 --> 01:04.060
This is used for just quick testing but most of the time you're not going to see professional programmers

01:04.420 --> 01:07.060
use this method very often.

01:08.570 --> 01:16.850
Instead most of the time we use something like code editors or I.D. Now nothing's preventing me from

01:17.180 --> 01:24.880
writing Python code in let's say a word document a Google Docs or a text file.

01:24.950 --> 01:32.270
But the problem with that is that well it just looks like text and when you make a spelling error when

01:32.270 --> 01:36.590
you write improper syntax where it's not Python code.

01:36.590 --> 01:41.660
If I'd just write it a word document it's not going to tell me any information.

01:41.690 --> 01:50.570
A professional developer need some extra tools that code editors and ideas provide that help us be more

01:50.570 --> 01:55.650
efficient with our code and we're going to be exploring that over the next couple of videos.

01:55.790 --> 02:01.160
But what is a code editor and an idea and what's the difference.

02:01.220 --> 02:08.690
We're actually going to show you how each of these work but a simple rule is that code editors are light

02:08.870 --> 02:17.000
weight they give you some really nice features like auto completion lynching which we're going to talk

02:17.000 --> 02:23.450
about while I.D. are full fledged environments.

02:23.630 --> 02:33.380
That is they provide a ton of extra stuff in order for us to just write really good code because of

02:33.380 --> 02:34.660
that they tend to be bigger.

02:34.660 --> 02:40.880
You have to download a large file size but they come with a lot of things like auto completion debugging

02:41.330 --> 02:45.050
code formatting unit testing code snippets.

02:45.050 --> 02:51.080
So on and so forth versus code editors where you have to just install bits and pieces and kind of create

02:51.170 --> 02:58.480
your own environment but enough talk let's actually install some of these and don't worry at the end.

02:58.490 --> 03:04.370
We'll also introduce you to this idea of a Jupiter notebook which is one of my favorites.
