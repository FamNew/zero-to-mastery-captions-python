00:00.630 --> 00:01.630
Welcome back.

00:01.650 --> 00:09.510
It's finally time to install Python the Python interpreter that we've been talking about for so long

00:10.650 --> 00:12.280
and if you're on Windows.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.770
This video is going to help you get set up.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.000
We're going to go to Python.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.180
Dot org.

00:18.210 --> 00:26.400
Click on downloads and make sure that we're downloading for Windows we're simply going to click and

00:26.400 --> 00:30.440
I'm going to run the installer.

00:30.460 --> 00:31.240
All right.

00:31.240 --> 00:35.350
Now this is really really important on Windows.

00:35.350 --> 00:40.320
You want to make sure that you click on Add Python to path.

00:40.330 --> 00:48.940
What this is going to allow us to do is to actually open up Python and use python from the command prompt.

00:48.940 --> 00:52.030
I'll show you that once we install this how it works.

00:52.030 --> 01:00.940
But make sure you click on this and also to install a launcher for all users which is recommended so

01:00.940 --> 01:08.850
I'm going to click install now and yes we'll say go ahead.

01:08.870 --> 01:14.840
Now you want to install based on your system you might have an older version of Windows a newer version.

01:15.080 --> 01:21.470
Usually the python dot or Web site will detect your machine and know what to install but obviously install

01:21.470 --> 01:27.620
according to why you have in my case it's a 32 bit system.

01:27.640 --> 01:28.910
All right come on.

01:28.910 --> 01:31.150
All right setup was successful.

01:31.150 --> 01:33.040
Let's close.

01:33.040 --> 01:41.590
And then what I want to do is actually use the command prompt yes I'm going to type into search command

01:42.250 --> 01:42.640
prompt

01:46.140 --> 01:47.370
if I click here.

01:47.550 --> 01:54.910
And now if I type in python a check that out we have Python working.

01:55.680 --> 01:56.730
Awesome.

01:56.730 --> 02:06.680
Now on windows you can also use something called Power shell and power Shell is actually well I prefer

02:06.680 --> 02:14.730
it over command prompt because the same commands that work on a Linux machine or a Mac will work on

02:14.730 --> 02:15.950
power shell.

02:15.960 --> 02:21.000
So again if I do Python here and hit enter.

02:21.000 --> 02:21.690
Look at that.

02:21.690 --> 02:23.820
Python is working as well.

02:23.820 --> 02:31.740
So if you have Windows and you have power shell available I do recommend you use partial because the

02:31.740 --> 02:41.130
commands that I use in the course will most likely work with partial another option for Windows is something

02:41.130 --> 02:43.220
called Get bash.

02:43.260 --> 02:46.740
So if I do get bash so forget bash.

02:46.740 --> 02:56.870
If you go to get four windows you'll see here that it comes with get bash which underneath the hood

02:57.620 --> 02:58.240
what it is.

02:58.250 --> 03:06.650
It's an emulation a bash emulation which is a shell to allow us to use Unix commands that can be used

03:06.650 --> 03:14.570
and Mac or on Linux on the windows machine so that if you ever watch it tutorial where the instructor

03:14.570 --> 03:18.510
is using a Mac for example you can use those same commands.

03:18.650 --> 03:25.760
So to review we have the option of using get bash if you want or you have the option of using command

03:25.760 --> 03:29.760
prompt or my personal favorite power show.

03:30.660 --> 03:38.340
So if you have partial on your device then I recommend using that if not get bash but because during

03:38.340 --> 03:47.340
our install clicked on that checkbox that says hey add Python to our path variable we're able to run

03:47.400 --> 03:54.810
this python command and actually enter the python wrap something that will become useful and you'll

03:54.810 --> 03:58.000
see why it's useful as we go through the course.

03:58.170 --> 04:01.730
But for now let's take a break and I'll see in the next video by.
