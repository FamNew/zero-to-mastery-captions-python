00:00.830 --> 00:02.070
Welcome back.

00:02.090 --> 00:06.950
Let's talk about formatting that is code formatting.

00:06.950 --> 00:15.320
A very important tool that comes with a lot of I.D. and you can also add extensions to code errors like

00:15.380 --> 00:18.690
Visual Studio code to format code.

00:18.740 --> 00:26.900
Now in order for us to talk about that we have to talk about Python pep and if you google Python pep

00:27.200 --> 00:34.370
you'll get something like this pep stands for Python enhancement proposals.

00:34.440 --> 00:41.010
These are proposals that the community the python developer community gives in order for us to have

00:41.010 --> 00:43.530
a standardized way to write code.

00:43.530 --> 00:50.190
And one of the more popular ones if you scroll down is what we called the PEP 8.

00:50.220 --> 00:54.040
You can see that there's a lot of pap numbers.

00:54.030 --> 01:00.090
Well pep 8 is the most popular one and it's a style guide for python code.

01:00.090 --> 01:08.220
It tells us this is what good clean Python coach you look like but luckily for you you don't have to

01:08.250 --> 01:11.460
click through here and read every single thing.

01:11.460 --> 01:17.000
I mean it is a lot code editors and ideas help us with this.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.780
Let's have a look.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.300
I have a piece of code here in my Hello Dot pie file.

01:23.130 --> 01:30.240
I mean it doesn't look that bad but how do we know for formatting the code according to pep 8.

01:30.240 --> 01:37.110
Well very easily we can run our command pallet or we can use a shortcut here.

01:37.110 --> 01:39.810
Command shift P or control shift p.

01:39.840 --> 01:49.760
If you're on Windows and then if we type in format document and click here we'll get hay for matter

01:49.890 --> 01:51.720
auto Pip rate is not install.

01:51.720 --> 02:00.030
Do you want to install it and auto Pip 8 is a popular package with the s code or extension that gives

02:00.030 --> 02:01.780
us the pep 8 format.

02:02.010 --> 02:06.820
So let's install this now.

02:07.150 --> 02:11.210
Let's once again run the format.

02:11.290 --> 02:19.130
Document and did you see that our code changed quite a bit.

02:19.150 --> 02:27.400
We have some spaces some formatting that went on and it did that automatically because of pep 8.

02:27.570 --> 02:37.160
As soon as I change something let's add some spaces here like that make our code just formatted really

02:37.160 --> 02:37.730
strange

02:41.970 --> 02:48.750
I click save and let's once again commence shift B format document.

02:48.770 --> 02:59.400
Now let's save this and here pep 8 formatting style was added for example with pep 8.

02:59.460 --> 03:04.100
It recommends that when you write functions that you have two spaces following it.

03:04.350 --> 03:08.280
So two spaces after every function once again.

03:08.290 --> 03:17.230
If I remove this and do format document you see that a space is added because of our auto pep 8 package.

03:17.260 --> 03:19.030
Very very cool.

03:19.030 --> 03:22.870
And you can also set this up so it does this automatically on safe.

03:23.290 --> 03:27.860
I'll leave that one to you to customize your editor and the way that you want.

03:27.880 --> 03:32.120
Now if we go to pie chart pie chart.

03:32.330 --> 03:34.870
Again we have the same code over here.

03:34.870 --> 03:39.760
Just larger text already has this installed for us as a matter of fact.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.660
You can see the underline here and says pep hate hate.

03:42.940 --> 03:46.810
I expected two blank lines after class or function definition.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.970
So it actually tells you that.

03:49.230 --> 03:49.660
All right.

03:49.660 --> 03:57.300
This is not good according to paid or maybe we can add extra spaces here and right away.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.390
Look at that pay pay.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.940
Multiple spaces after keyword we don't want that.

04:02.100 --> 04:05.010
Now all we have to do here is simply go to

04:08.270 --> 04:12.020
and reformat code and you can also see the shortcut available.

04:12.020 --> 04:13.580
If I do this.

04:13.730 --> 04:15.970
Look at that the code was reformatted.

04:15.980 --> 04:20.140
Let's make this a little smaller and everything seems to be working.

04:20.330 --> 04:22.370
And I also get a little error.

04:22.460 --> 04:24.160
This is not pep 8.

04:24.170 --> 04:27.050
Again it's another suggestion by the editor.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.540
Tell me that you've created a new function.

04:29.540 --> 04:39.290
Some but some actually exists in Python so you're almost overwriting this again a really really neat

04:39.380 --> 04:42.230
feature of pie chart and you know what.

04:42.230 --> 04:50.090
Just because we have a little bit of time just to show you how you can use a yes code to just save or

04:50.090 --> 05:01.760
format on save I can simply go to preferences settings and type in format and if I scroll to format

05:01.790 --> 05:08.760
on safe I can click on that you can see that changes have been automatically implemented.

05:08.820 --> 05:12.850
So now every time I do command s and save look at that.

05:12.960 --> 05:22.880
If formatted for me so that we can make sure that we write clean Python code according to the standards.

05:23.030 --> 05:24.890
Let's take a break and I'll see you in the next one.

05:25.540 --> 05:25.730
Bobby.
