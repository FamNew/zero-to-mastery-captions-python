00:01.060 --> 00:08.230
By the way remember this exercise that we did where we pretended to have a picture that was stored on

00:08.230 --> 00:17.500
our computer and we had to create this script to read through our data and add a space or a blank.

00:17.500 --> 00:24.040
If there is a zero and if there's a want to add a star which gave us a little Christmas tree and although

00:24.040 --> 00:30.760
we've been using the ripple up until now at the end of the day all Python code whether you're writing

00:31.000 --> 00:39.010
Python for games whether you're writing Python for scripts to read your Excel spreadsheets or maybe

00:39.040 --> 00:44.040
you're using Python to do some machine learning at the end of the day.

00:44.290 --> 00:53.290
All we're doing is well we're writing a program and then this program gets run by a machine something

00:53.290 --> 01:02.650
like this here I have a one dot pi file that I've just created and then here as you can see we have

01:03.190 --> 01:05.540
our script that we had in our rebel.

01:05.720 --> 01:08.130
But I've just created it on my computer.

01:08.170 --> 01:15.250
It's one dot Pi I can name it whatever I want and usually a way a program runs again.

01:15.250 --> 01:21.810
Any type of Python program any type of programming language we can use something like our terminal.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.970
If you're on a Mac you can use the terminal or if you have a Linux based machine you can use a terminal

01:27.970 --> 01:34.990
as well or if you're on a Windows computer using the command prompt or the power shell.

01:35.200 --> 01:43.120
So that here if I wanted to run the wand pi file I make sure that my present working directory is where

01:43.120 --> 01:45.940
my file exists which is on my desktop.

01:46.000 --> 01:53.560
Remember that on Windows you'd say directory or desire to find out what you're present working directory

01:53.600 --> 02:01.360
is once you're in the same directory remember if you're not you can see these in two different locations

02:01.840 --> 02:10.650
to get to where the file is and then we run the file by saying python in our case 3 again based on whatever

02:10.650 --> 02:15.910
interpreter you want to use and just say one dot by and there you go.

02:16.020 --> 02:23.820
Our graphical user interface of displaying the tree is working and although this is a simple example

02:24.390 --> 02:29.550
that's all code is code is being run by a machine like this.

02:29.550 --> 02:36.480
We just say hey run this python file or multiple files through the Python interpreter and the machine

02:36.510 --> 02:38.050
is going to do something.

02:38.070 --> 02:40.300
We created a Christmas tree generator.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.870
So that's what the machine does.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.200
But the machine can do anything.

02:44.370 --> 02:47.220
It can build games and run games.

02:47.220 --> 02:49.120
It can do machine learning models.

02:49.140 --> 02:50.550
It can do visuals.

02:50.550 --> 02:53.960
It can simply send emails to your friends.

02:53.970 --> 02:56.010
The possibilities are endless.

02:56.130 --> 02:59.720
And it will explore those topics in our projects coming up.

02:59.790 --> 03:00.300
And of course.
