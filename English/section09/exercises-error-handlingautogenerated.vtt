00:00.360 --> 00:08.070
Let's go back to our example of our game where we have a user log in and they have to provide their

00:08.070 --> 00:08.550
age.

00:08.580 --> 00:12.540
Remember if I click run it's going to ask me Hey what's your age.

00:12.540 --> 00:20.810
And if I give it something that doesn't like it's going to keep asking me until I provide a proper value.

00:20.870 --> 00:25.190
There's one other piece to try except block that we haven't covered.

00:25.310 --> 00:30.630
So we know that we have try we have except and then we have else.

00:30.830 --> 00:39.220
But there's also another thing called finally and finally runs at the end after everything has been

00:39.250 --> 00:40.460
executed.

00:40.480 --> 00:40.960
Let me show you.

00:41.290 --> 00:50.130
If I do print I'll say OK I'm finally done.

00:50.160 --> 00:59.440
Let's see what happens if I click run here and I give it a proper age I get thank you because my try

00:59.440 --> 01:00.880
Bork succeeded.

01:00.940 --> 01:02.490
Nothing has failed.

01:02.530 --> 01:14.470
I go to the else and I say thank you and now I break out of the while loop but finally says hey no matter

01:14.470 --> 01:21.880
what at the end of it all I want you to finally do something let's see this in action if I do something

01:21.880 --> 01:26.560
like zero I get please enter H higher than zero.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.640
But then also still get.

01:28.660 --> 01:30.210
OK I'm finally done.

01:30.470 --> 01:38.500
What if I enter a gibberish I get hey please enter a number but also ok I'm finally done.

01:38.540 --> 01:45.090
So finally runs regardless at the end of everything.

01:45.190 --> 01:47.470
Why is this useful.

01:47.470 --> 01:53.770
Maybe you're working on a game server and you want to make sure that you log out any activity on the

01:53.770 --> 01:54.370
server.

01:54.370 --> 02:00.550
So let's say a user tries to log in even if they try to enter the wrong information.

02:00.670 --> 02:06.430
We want to log that activity so that maybe we can detect that there's people trying to break our program

02:06.760 --> 02:14.450
or just to have our records that hey this user has tried to log in 10 times so finally is very useful.

02:14.480 --> 02:17.690
Now let me ask you a question.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.350
What happens if I do something like this.

02:20.570 --> 02:21.960
Let's say I have here.

02:22.130 --> 02:32.840
Continue and maybe another break statement here and then maybe inside of here I'm also going to have

02:32.840 --> 02:35.210
a print.

02:35.270 --> 02:40.640
Can you hear me.

02:40.650 --> 02:45.910
What happens if I do something like this pause the video if you need to.

02:45.910 --> 02:49.270
Otherwise I'm going to hit run and see what's going to happen.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.760
What is going to happen if I enter 0

02:55.550 --> 03:03.390
I get please enter higher than 0 because I get a zero division error a catches here and then we break

03:03.480 --> 03:11.370
out of the loop the finally gets run but print never runs because well we break out of the loop and

03:11.370 --> 03:14.390
remember this is surrounded by the loop.

03:14.580 --> 03:19.150
Let me remove this so we can see it better OK.

03:19.430 --> 03:22.390
What happens if I do something like this.

03:22.490 --> 03:26.930
What if we run the program again and this time give it gibberish

03:31.510 --> 03:35.290
I get please entry no OK I'm finally done.

03:35.290 --> 03:37.830
And then what's your age.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.430
So what happened here.

03:40.430 --> 03:42.080
Well we tried this.

03:42.110 --> 03:46.200
We got an error a value error it says hey please enter a number.

03:46.490 --> 03:48.650
And then it's going to continue.

03:48.830 --> 03:49.790
Now continue.

03:49.790 --> 03:56.050
Instead of break doesn't break out of the loop out of the while loop instead it comes back to the top.

03:56.450 --> 03:58.910
So it's going to try again this part.

03:58.910 --> 04:00.560
What's your age.

04:00.560 --> 04:00.970
OK.

04:01.100 --> 04:06.970
So what if we finally try to log in properly and give it hey we're a team.

04:07.010 --> 04:09.260
What happens that.

04:09.260 --> 04:10.610
There you go.

04:10.610 --> 04:17.060
I get thank you because we've tried it everything works so no exception.

04:17.060 --> 04:18.000
So we are gonna get.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.130
Thank you.

04:19.130 --> 04:21.580
And then we break out of the loop.

04:21.650 --> 04:25.070
So once again this print never gets printed.

04:25.070 --> 04:26.010
Can you hear me.

04:26.030 --> 04:27.140
But then finally.

04:27.140 --> 04:27.400
OK.

04:27.420 --> 04:28.830
Finally is done.

04:28.970 --> 04:36.530
If we didn't have this break statement here and I click Run and give it 18.

04:36.790 --> 04:43.830
Oh boy finally I can hear you this print finally gets printed because we don't break out of here.

04:43.930 --> 04:50.940
We don't break out of here and then we run this line hopefully that makes sense.

04:50.940 --> 04:52.250
That was a bit of a trick question.

04:52.260 --> 04:55.230
But you're starting to get the hang of it.

04:55.260 --> 04:57.460
I'll see you in the next video by.
