00:00.710 --> 00:01.710
Welcome back.

00:01.730 --> 00:11.940
I want to talk to you about this idea of introspection and introspection in computer programming means

00:11.940 --> 00:17.220
the ability to determine the type of an object at runtime.

00:17.220 --> 00:18.300
What is runtime.

00:18.300 --> 00:20.250
That is when the code is running.

00:20.370 --> 00:28.260
You can determine the type of an object and it's actually one of Python's strengths because everything

00:28.260 --> 00:30.350
in Python is an object.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.040
We can examine.

00:32.040 --> 00:39.570
We can introspect an object and actually figure out what our code does as we're coding and then running

00:40.650 --> 00:51.080
and Python allows us to do introspection and inspect these objects with some nice helper functions this

00:51.170 --> 01:05.950
one function is called dir and Der Well if I run this will give me all of the methods and attributes

01:06.220 --> 01:08.860
that the wizard instant has.

01:08.860 --> 01:16.560
So with a dir function we give it an instance and right away we get access to what it has access to.

01:16.720 --> 01:21.700
Well we see that we have name power and sign in again.

01:21.770 --> 01:24.080
We have the sign in from the user.

01:24.080 --> 01:34.990
And then we have also attack from the Wizard class and this Ed that I'm using whenever I do dot is actually

01:34.990 --> 01:42.580
using this ability of introspection to just list out these available methods for me just like I have

01:42.880 --> 01:44.080
here.

01:44.080 --> 01:50.260
So this is really useful when you're trying to figure out why you have access to but you may notice

01:50.260 --> 01:51.230
something here.

01:51.310 --> 01:57.930
We have a lot of these Dunder or magic methods that we haven't really talked about.

01:58.090 --> 02:02.920
What are these and why are they so important in the next video.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.990
We're going to tackle this question.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.160
I'll see you now.

02:06.380 --> 02:06.630
Bobby.
