00:00.590 --> 00:01.880
Welcome back.

00:01.880 --> 00:08.510
Up until this point we learned that Opie or object oriented programming is a paradigm a way for us to

00:08.510 --> 00:10.930
think about structuring our code.

00:10.940 --> 00:18.400
We went from procedural to writing functions to now using things like object oriented programming.

00:18.410 --> 00:25.310
Now what we've seen is what we call a classical Opie that is we use classes to incorporate Object Oriented

00:25.490 --> 00:32.100
Programming Paradigms we learn that we can create a class in Python with a class keyword.

00:32.250 --> 00:39.260
Using this naming convention which is camel case with capital letter which tells other programmers that

00:39.260 --> 00:47.030
this is a class that needs to get instantiated we learned about class object attributes we learned about

00:47.030 --> 00:55.030
how we can instantiate an object and how we have this init function that runs on every instantiation

00:55.210 --> 00:57.700
to customize our objects.

00:57.730 --> 01:05.380
We learned about how to add methods to our class so that each object that we create and instantiate

01:05.560 --> 01:07.900
has access to these methods.

01:07.900 --> 01:13.090
We also learned that there's things like class method and static methods which are methods that can

01:13.090 --> 01:22.190
be called on the class without actually instantiating it into an object and all of this was that so

01:22.190 --> 01:26.470
we can create our own data type the models the real world.

01:26.510 --> 01:33.200
Now there's still lots more to learn and object oriented programming but if you follow these guidelines

01:33.290 --> 01:37.400
and look at this overall structure that's pretty much it.

01:37.460 --> 01:45.320
That's how classes work in Python and we actually have gained a really powerful tool now to really make

01:45.320 --> 01:46.890
our code better.

01:47.030 --> 01:53.360
Now the idea of object oriented programming require some practice and it's really hard to grasp when

01:53.360 --> 01:55.310
you're just starting out.

01:55.430 --> 02:00.590
We're going to try and do some exercises and learn a few more things about object oriented programming

02:00.830 --> 02:07.300
so that we can really grasp this concept and use it in our everyday programs.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.470
I'll see in the next one.

02:08.500 --> 02:08.770
Bobby.
