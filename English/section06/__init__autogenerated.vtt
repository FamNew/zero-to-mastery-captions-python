I want to add a quick note about this constructor function.

00:05.190 --> 00:10.260
Remember this gets called every time we instantiate an object.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.950
And this is how we create custom object.

00:13.020 --> 00:13.980
Right.

00:14.100 --> 00:19.110
But an interesting thing that you can do here because you have control over how the instantiation happens

00:19.350 --> 00:21.570
you can do different safeguards.

00:21.570 --> 00:25.060
For example let's remove this for now because we don't need it.

00:25.930 --> 00:29.160
Or actually let's change this to let's to age.

00:29.200 --> 00:38.140
We want to check if the user is over 18 then we're going to run this otherwise while the program is

00:38.140 --> 00:44.260
going to error out because we only let people age 18 and over to play the game because let's say it's

00:44.260 --> 00:50.530
rated R so we can do different things in the constructor to make sure that we are instantiating the

00:50.530 --> 00:52.150
object the proper way.

00:52.300 --> 00:59.640
We can also give default parameters like name can be anonymous if we wanted to.

00:59.650 --> 01:05.810
If they don't provide a name and then age will be let's say 0.

01:05.860 --> 01:06.950
If they don't provide a name.

01:07.870 --> 01:08.860
So that here.

01:08.860 --> 01:19.360
Let's say I forget to instantiate Player 1 and Player 2 if I click Run I get an error Player object

01:19.570 --> 01:24.320
has no attribute name and this is on line eleven.

01:24.580 --> 01:28.500
Now why do we not have self Don name.

01:28.510 --> 01:34.570
Well because on line 17 you are trying to call shout but unfortunately we never instantiated this because

01:34.990 --> 01:38.730
when we don't provide anything the age is going to be 0.

01:39.010 --> 01:43.820
So we're never going to instantiate with these properties OK.

01:43.850 --> 01:54.830
So let's just give it time and then age is going to be 10 and let's just remove Player 2 for now if

01:54.830 --> 01:55.550
I do.

01:55.670 --> 01:58.460
Player 1 Got shut and I click.

01:58.460 --> 01:58.790
Run

02:01.770 --> 02:06.420
once again I get an error because well Tom is only 10 years old.

02:06.540 --> 02:08.510
We're not going to create this character.

02:08.760 --> 02:14.730
Now we're gonna talk about errors and maybe instead of just having this error out we can send a message

02:14.730 --> 02:23.190
saying Hey player is not old enough but for now I hope you see the power that comes with this idea of

02:23.190 --> 02:31.740
constructor and the instantiation of an object where we're able to add these different controls and

02:31.740 --> 02:39.120
safeguards to perhaps make sure that we receive their right data type in order to create the object

02:39.390 --> 02:46.080
or maybe the age is over 18 in order to make sure that when we actually instantiate this player one

02:46.440 --> 02:49.200
object we're doing it the right way.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.380
So this in it gives you a lot of control.
