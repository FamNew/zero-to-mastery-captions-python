00:00.540 --> 00:02.080
Welcome back.

00:02.080 --> 00:08.040
This was probably an exercise that sounded a lot more complicated than it actually was.

00:08.080 --> 00:14.710
So hopefully most of you were able to solve it if you didn't by the time you watch this video you're

00:14.710 --> 00:19.190
going to say to yourself oh that was so simple I should've figured it out.

00:19.390 --> 00:21.510
So don't worry we'll get there.

00:21.520 --> 00:28.020
Let's see how we can do that well if we go to Hacker News you might notice something when you click

00:28.020 --> 00:35.330
on more when you click on more you actually get a new you are all here with.

00:35.400 --> 00:40.570
Well you see the query string which is a question mark here that says Pete too.

00:40.710 --> 00:44.540
So if I do p equals three here we go to pastry.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.340
We go to page four and so on and so forth.

00:48.420 --> 00:56.670
So all we actually need is just this link and all we need to do is go all the way up to our code.

00:56.670 --> 01:01.550
Let's minimize this for now and simply just duplicate what we've just done.

01:02.890 --> 01:10.750
We grab a second response and this response will be requests start get.

01:10.960 --> 01:25.140
And this link with page two from here we simply grab this soup and recreate it as soup to and that's

01:25.150 --> 01:30.740
going to be from the response to the text again.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.700
What we'll do here is We'll duplicate this code.

01:33.720 --> 01:38.910
And again if you notice that this could be more efficient maybe we can extract this into a function

01:39.150 --> 01:47.890
that's good you sound to notice these things so here we're just going to do links to subtext to well

01:47.950 --> 01:58.150
you'll grab from our soup too and well soup to and we can now just combine these two things by simply

01:58.330 --> 02:05.190
calling let's call it mega links which will combine these links with the second links.

02:05.200 --> 02:10.630
So we're combining the two pages and we'll do the same for mega subtext

02:13.610 --> 02:23.780
which you'll be subtext plus subtext to and because we've written our code in nice functions all we

02:23.780 --> 02:26.940
need to do now is replace our parameters.

02:26.990 --> 02:27.760
Right.

02:27.800 --> 02:35.980
All we need to do at the bottom here is say mega links and mega subtext.

02:35.980 --> 02:39.540
If I see this this should now work.

02:39.590 --> 02:40.210
Let's have a look

02:47.560 --> 02:51.640
go and classic me made a bit of a spelling error.

02:51.660 --> 02:55.080
If we go over here it's not moving the subtext.

02:55.080 --> 03:01.900
It's mega subtext let's run this again you'll see here that it takes a little bit longer.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.210
Again because we're going to two pages.

03:04.210 --> 03:05.770
But look at that.

03:06.040 --> 03:10.930
We have our hacker news using two pages.

03:10.930 --> 03:15.820
You can see that it's clearly longer and we have a story here with nine hundred and fifty one votes.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.120
I should I should definitely read that.

03:18.250 --> 03:22.890
How to access quality of garments sounds very important.

03:22.980 --> 03:30.810
And there you have it you have now just covered the basics of scraping as you can see it's very specific

03:30.840 --> 03:33.420
to a Web site that you want to scrape.

03:33.420 --> 03:40.020
Remember you want to check to make sure that A you are able to scrape the Web sites by checking the

03:40.020 --> 03:47.610
terms and conditions of that Web site and robots dot text and try to use the data in well not nefarious

03:47.610 --> 03:48.140
ways.

03:48.150 --> 03:54.390
Be nice be ethical in the next video we're going to talk a little bit about how to expand on this and

03:54.600 --> 04:00.830
what you might want to try if you want to get more and more involved with web scraping.

04:00.870 --> 04:02.430
I'll see you on that one by.
