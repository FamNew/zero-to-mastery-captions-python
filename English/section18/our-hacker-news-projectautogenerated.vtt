00:00.730 --> 00:01.920
Welcome back.

00:01.930 --> 00:08.830
In order to learn about web scraping let's actually build a useful project that we can actually use

00:08.950 --> 00:11.520
and maybe even add to our portfolio.

00:11.590 --> 00:20.290
What I want to build is a nicer version of Hacker News You see every morning as a programmer I wake

00:20.290 --> 00:26.740
up and I usually read hacker news because it's a great way for myself to stay up to date with the industry

00:26.770 --> 00:30.500
and just learn about general programming news.

00:30.520 --> 00:35.770
They have some really really nice articles here and a lot of programmers use Hacker News as a way to

00:35.770 --> 00:37.930
stay up to date with the industry.

00:37.930 --> 00:42.370
This page has a ton of information.

00:42.370 --> 00:49.120
As a matter of fact every time you refresh it's a new topic new you think if I go to the new tab here

00:49.120 --> 00:56.350
for example you see that these stories as I refresh news stories get added constantly.

00:56.560 --> 01:03.460
So it's a very fast paced Web site because a lot of people post news links here to get traction because

01:03.670 --> 01:05.190
there's so many readers here.

01:05.290 --> 01:12.130
Now in order for me not to get overwhelmed I usually only like reading or checking out the stories that

01:12.130 --> 01:13.940
have over 100 points.

01:13.990 --> 01:21.950
That is they've been uploaded by users so let's build the tool using web scraping that when I wake up

01:21.950 --> 01:28.220
in the morning instead of having to scroll through and find out all the stories that have over 100 points

01:28.520 --> 01:32.770
because those are the most popular ones maybe the most important ones.

01:32.930 --> 01:42.920
Let's scrape this data and then remove all the stories that well have less than 100 points so that I

01:42.920 --> 01:46.570
can only focus on the important news article.

01:46.590 --> 01:48.070
Sounds pretty exciting right.

01:48.080 --> 01:53.990
That's a great use of Python to make our life easier now after we're done with this project there are

01:53.990 --> 01:56.390
many ways to apply this knowledge.

01:56.390 --> 02:04.430
For example one of the things that Hacker News has is every month they have a who's hiring where companies

02:04.430 --> 02:07.680
post job opportunities for programmers.

02:07.700 --> 02:15.650
So a good project might be to actually scrape this data of companies posting different job opportunities

02:15.950 --> 02:22.250
and maybe try and figure out what the trends are what type of programmers are the most in demand.

02:22.370 --> 02:25.010
Hey are Python programmers the most in demand.

02:25.070 --> 02:32.990
Maybe by scraping and finding how many times the word python gets mentioned or maybe is Java or Javascript

02:32.990 --> 02:33.770
programmers.

02:33.770 --> 02:41.720
The most common and maybe you can create a Web site that tracks the trends of different posts to see

02:42.170 --> 02:46.610
well what skill you should be learning to stay up to date and make sure that it's the most in demand

02:46.610 --> 02:47.450
skill.

02:47.540 --> 02:51.100
Just an idea but let's focus on this for now.

02:51.410 --> 02:59.390
In order for us to scrape this Web site we want to use a tool called Beautiful Soup and beautiful soup

02:59.600 --> 03:01.220
is what we can use in Python.

03:01.220 --> 03:06.290
It's a library that we can use in Python to scrape Web sites.

03:06.380 --> 03:13.130
They have a very old school web site here but it's a very useful tool that most web scraping projects

03:13.130 --> 03:14.160
use.

03:14.270 --> 03:17.560
So in the next video we're going to get our hands dirty.

03:17.570 --> 03:25.260
We're going to learn about beautiful soup and start creating our web scraping project with Hacker News.

03:25.270 --> 03:25.930
Let's get started.
