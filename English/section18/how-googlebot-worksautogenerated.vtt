00:00.570 --> 00:01.150
Hey there.

00:01.240 --> 00:07.840
I want to add a quick note about what we just saw with Air being beat and how search Web sites like

00:07.840 --> 00:12.020
being bi do and Google actually work.

00:12.090 --> 00:20.790
Now you may have noticed that the user agent Google bought is well what Google uses to index Web sites.

00:20.790 --> 00:21.480
What does that mean.

00:22.290 --> 00:26.950
Well Google the way it works remember is a search engine.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.340
What it does is it tries to figure out all the Web sites on the web and index them.

00:34.350 --> 00:44.400
That is create a essentially a database of all these web pages so that when I google soup recipes google

00:44.400 --> 00:49.240
gives me a Web site that has soup recipes now.

00:49.250 --> 00:53.390
How does it know what Web sites have soup recipes.

00:53.390 --> 00:55.860
Well it uses this Google Bob.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.730
And this is how Google got started.

00:58.730 --> 01:07.130
What they did was they had a crawler that is a program that crawled Web sites and read Web sites kind

01:07.130 --> 01:12.130
of like we're about to do with web scraping to understand what the Web site is about.

01:12.260 --> 01:19.940
If the Web site mentioned the word soup recipes or had different tacks to relate it to soup recipes.

01:20.240 --> 01:24.500
Well Google board is going to say this Web site is about soup recipes.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.060
So when Andre's searches.

01:26.060 --> 01:34.650
Soup recipes I know that these Web sites are the ones that we want to show in and this is what Google

01:34.650 --> 01:42.570
and being and bi do all do they have their own bots and they're constantly crawling Web sites to see

01:42.660 --> 01:46.550
what is the most relevant Web site to give to a user.

01:46.560 --> 01:53.610
So everybody here is saying Hey Google but when you come crawl my web site don't crawl any of these

01:53.610 --> 01:56.050
things because I don't want you to.

01:56.100 --> 01:59.630
But anything else that's not here you can crawl.

01:59.790 --> 02:06.870
Now if you actually look through here this is not everything on Air B and B because Air B and B wants

02:06.870 --> 02:09.060
Google to crawl the Web site.

02:09.060 --> 02:09.590
Right.

02:09.600 --> 02:17.310
If I search for vacation homes in Costa Rica Air B and B is interested for Google to post an Air B and

02:17.310 --> 02:20.200
B link to the top of the search.

02:20.310 --> 02:28.230
So what they disallow here is mostly user specific thing that Google shouldn't have access to like maybe

02:28.260 --> 02:37.580
reservations or payments but there's a lot of other endpoints that are actually allowed for Google bought

02:37.850 --> 02:39.300
to search.

02:39.350 --> 02:46.550
For example Google bought is most likely allowed to look at all the houses available in Costa Rica and

02:46.550 --> 02:51.260
actually ranked them so that when I type in Costa Rica house rental.

02:51.470 --> 02:59.420
Well Google bought is going to say hey everybody has a link to Costa Rica houses will give that to this

02:59.420 --> 03:00.050
user.

03:00.050 --> 03:03.200
So anything that's not in this list.

03:03.200 --> 03:07.890
Well we're allowed to use one tricky thing is that we see this allow here.

03:08.120 --> 03:15.380
What this allow means it says hey calendar here is actually a disallowed endpoint.

03:15.440 --> 03:18.740
However we allow inside of the calendar.

03:18.740 --> 03:22.390
This I call folder you can access that one only.

03:22.550 --> 03:24.980
But if it's not mentioned here.

03:24.980 --> 03:29.060
So if anything in here on this list is not mentioned.

03:29.060 --> 03:30.310
That is a lot.

03:30.320 --> 03:34.440
So for example Air B and B dot slash that's allowed.

03:34.460 --> 03:40.040
Because that wasn't on the list if I maybe click on experiences.

03:40.250 --> 03:47.850
This is allowed because this dash S slash S slash experiences was not on the list.

03:47.900 --> 03:55.130
So a Web site either has a robot stuck text file because maybe it doesn't want specific things scroll

03:55.820 --> 04:03.470
or if it doesn't have a robust text file or just leaves it empty it means hey I don't care.

04:03.620 --> 04:05.410
Google you can rank my Web site.

04:05.420 --> 04:06.740
You can crawl my Web site.

04:06.770 --> 04:07.640
That's good too.

04:07.670 --> 04:11.210
And that's why I Air B and B had different information here.

04:11.240 --> 04:16.610
We had specifically for Google board for being bought for all these search engines but also for everybody

04:16.610 --> 04:23.600
else maybe programmers like us that want to scrape the Web site there you know we secretly learn how

04:23.810 --> 04:26.540
Google and other search engines work.

04:26.540 --> 04:27.620
Pretty cool right.

04:27.620 --> 04:29.480
All right let's get back to the topic at hand.
