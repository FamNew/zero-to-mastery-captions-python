Let's talk about Web scraping.

00:03.700 --> 00:08.370
One of the things we can do with python what is web scraping.

00:08.380 --> 00:16.990
Well web scraping simply means programmatically using Python or any language grabbing data from a Web

00:16.990 --> 00:18.230
site.

00:18.230 --> 00:27.280
So for example I can grab data from Amazon from air being B from maybe a recipe Web site.

00:27.290 --> 00:30.380
Any Web site can be scraped.

00:30.380 --> 00:37.220
So essentially when we talk about Web scraping we mean downloading a web page grabbing the data from

00:37.220 --> 00:43.790
that web page cleaning it up somehow so that it's useful for us and then using that data.

00:44.030 --> 00:47.480
You see this is how Web sites work.

00:47.480 --> 00:53.280
We have a browser that we use like a chrome and we have a server.

00:53.420 --> 01:00.980
A server is simply a computer somewhere in the world that has three files that are needed to display

01:01.010 --> 01:02.170
a web page.

01:02.180 --> 01:06.640
We have an HMO file which is the content of the Web site.

01:06.650 --> 01:10.750
You can think of that as text and images of a Web site.

01:10.790 --> 01:16.730
We have CSX which gives us the colors and pretty styling that Web sites have.

01:16.730 --> 01:22.190
And then we have Javascript which allows us to have different behaviors in our Web site like submitting

01:22.190 --> 01:31.820
forms or having dropdown menus and all a browser does like Chrome is say hey if Andre visits this Web

01:31.820 --> 01:39.410
site let's say FIFA dot com browser is going to know when I type in FIFA dot com that says hey server

01:39.710 --> 01:42.150
can you give me the FIFA dot com.

01:42.150 --> 01:48.320
A simple CSF in JavaScript files and the server says yep no problem here they are.

01:48.320 --> 01:52.040
And then the page get displayed onto our browser.

01:52.640 --> 01:58.150
So these three files Well the data in them is accessible to us.

01:58.190 --> 01:58.520
Right.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.820
It gets displayed on a web page.

02:01.850 --> 02:06.080
So these files are now something that we can actually check up.

02:06.080 --> 02:13.100
For example if we go to the FIFA dot com Web site you see over here that well we have a pretty page

02:13.280 --> 02:14.690
with a lot of information.

02:14.750 --> 02:15.980
That's great.

02:15.980 --> 02:25.610
And if I right click here and do view page source this is the A.T.M. page of the FIFA Web site.

02:25.940 --> 02:36.850
As you can see it's pretty long but it has all the data that we see in this page.

02:36.990 --> 02:45.770
Now the C Ss and JavaScript files are linked to it but the main data that is the text maybe the images

02:47.140 --> 02:49.220
are all here.

02:49.240 --> 02:56.520
So for example we have latest news we have top 10 goals from the woman's World Cup.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.070
Well let's find out.

02:58.140 --> 03:03.700
Let's say top 10 goals from the Women's World Cup.

03:03.740 --> 03:04.700
You see that's what we have.

03:04.700 --> 03:15.590
We have the text right here in the web scraping is simply this grabbing this data and then removing

03:15.590 --> 03:19.810
all the parts that we don't care about and just keeping the parts that we care about.

03:19.910 --> 03:23.950
And web scraping works because this information is public.

03:24.050 --> 03:27.960
In order for a Web site to get displayed it has to be public.

03:28.700 --> 03:36.020
Maybe you're still wondering why web scraping might be useful Well there are many many cases for it.

03:36.060 --> 03:42.540
For example I'll link to this resource where it talks about some of the big uses for web scraping.

03:42.540 --> 03:50.220
Why would we want to scrape a Web site and you can see here there's many reasons.

03:50.220 --> 03:51.840
Maybe you want to get sale leads.

03:51.840 --> 03:58.290
That is you want to collect all the e-mails that are on a web page maybe a contact form.

03:58.560 --> 04:02.400
Maybe you have a yoga office software product.

04:02.550 --> 04:09.930
Maybe go to every single yoga studios web page and find the contact information scrape that data so

04:09.930 --> 04:11.700
you don't have to manually do it.

04:11.730 --> 04:16.560
Maybe you want to find all the jobs and open positions on a Web site.

04:17.010 --> 04:22.890
And instead of manually clicking through different pages you can scrape that data and there's many many

04:22.980 --> 04:27.190
use cases in our project that we're going to built for this session.

04:27.210 --> 04:33.110
We're actually going to scrape Hacker News a very popular Web site for many programmers and we're gonna

04:33.150 --> 04:40.110
turn this into something even more useful for us to read analyze and stay current with our industry.

04:40.110 --> 04:41.790
But we'll get to that in a bit.

04:41.790 --> 04:46.590
Let's take a break here and learn a little bit more about web scraping in the next video.
