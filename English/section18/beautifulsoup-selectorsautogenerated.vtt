WEBVTT

00:00.710 --> 00:09.020
Now one of the best ways in my opinion to actually use this soup object is to use the select method

00:09.080 --> 00:18.200
on it and select allows us to grab a piece of data from the soup that we just downloaded and created

00:18.890 --> 00:22.590
using what we call a CSX selector.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.710
Now this is a Python course.

00:24.740 --> 00:28.210
So we're not going to focus too much on CSX selectors.

00:28.250 --> 00:31.330
I will link to a resource so you can learn more about them.

00:31.490 --> 00:40.710
But a CSX selector allows us to access this data using well CSF selectors.

00:40.730 --> 00:50.240
So if I Google here CSF selectors you see here that well it's a list of different ways to grab elements

00:50.690 --> 00:57.220
on an HMO page we can use the class the idea the actual element.

00:57.300 --> 01:06.480
So let me show you how to do that I can say for example select a and what is this going to do.

01:06.560 --> 01:12.640
Well if I run this script it's going to select all the attacks.

01:12.980 --> 01:13.250
OK.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.090
That's nothing new.

01:14.090 --> 01:15.180
We've seen that before.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.490
We can do that for Dev as well if we want it to.

01:18.770 --> 01:29.340
But we can go beyond just an element and say we want to select let's say the class score so this class

01:29.340 --> 01:33.140
score can be accessed by using the dot notation.

01:33.150 --> 01:38.490
So dot score is going to grab all the scores on the page.

01:38.490 --> 01:39.450
So watch this.

01:39.450 --> 01:49.190
If I clear this and run here look at that I grabbed all the spam tags that have scores on them.

01:49.190 --> 01:57.680
So you see over here that this is just a list of all the spans because this span has a class of score

01:58.400 --> 02:09.320
this span has a class of score and we can do the same thing with ideas so if you wanted to grab this

02:09.320 --> 02:16.840
idea we simply say instead of a dot which stands for a class we do pound and then the idea.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.530
So if I run this

02:22.370 --> 02:31.740
we get this one span because this is the only one with this specific idea now I'll link to a resource

02:31.740 --> 02:34.610
where you can learn about more C assess selectors.

02:34.740 --> 02:41.780
They become really really powerful when you start selecting different complicated nested elements.

02:41.790 --> 02:43.050
Let me show you.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.580
Let's start to plan out what we want to do.

02:46.290 --> 02:55.180
Now in here I'm going to close this for now I want to grab the link over here so that is the title and

02:55.180 --> 03:02.760
the link of a story that has more than 100 points votes and everything else that doesn't have 100 points

03:02.760 --> 03:03.930
like this one.

03:03.930 --> 03:05.230
I just don't care about.

03:05.370 --> 03:08.110
So I'm just filtering Get out.

03:08.160 --> 03:16.510
So what we want to do is first of all grab this link and grab this votes.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.770
So we also list out how many votes this story has.

03:19.770 --> 03:26.430
So the way I'm going to do this is I'm going to right click click inspect what we know is that we want

03:26.430 --> 03:31.440
to grab this link that has a class of Story link.

03:31.740 --> 03:38.700
OK so just to double check if I go to this one over here and inspect you see that here.

03:38.700 --> 03:42.210
This one has a class of Story link as well.

03:42.210 --> 03:48.510
So let's just grab all the elements that have class story link and see what happens.

03:48.610 --> 03:53.880
I'm going to say dot Story link because dot means it's a class.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.110
And let's see what we get.

03:56.110 --> 03:58.000
I'm going to run the file

04:00.730 --> 04:01.050
and.

04:01.060 --> 04:07.160
All right we get a ton of lists but it looks like they're all a tax.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.860
So these are all links that we can use.

04:09.970 --> 04:17.470
It looks like this is a list so we can probably grab it using the square bracket 0 to grab the first

04:17.470 --> 04:18.310
element.

04:18.460 --> 04:21.770
Let's see if this works I'm going to go.

04:22.250 --> 04:28.400
I'm going to clear here and run this again.

04:28.460 --> 04:29.160
All right.

04:29.390 --> 04:33.260
Look at that visual information theory 2015.

04:33.320 --> 04:35.390
That's the first item in here.

04:35.450 --> 04:42.780
So it looks like Story link grabs us the tags the links for each one of these items.

04:42.780 --> 04:43.000
OK.

04:43.010 --> 04:44.570
What about votes.

04:44.570 --> 04:46.130
Let's grab the votes as well.

04:46.130 --> 04:51.020
I'm going to right click say inspect and what do we have here.

04:51.060 --> 04:53.580
We see that we have class of score.

04:53.580 --> 05:06.410
So let's just grab all the classes so I'm going to say that this is going to be links and that is well

05:06.710 --> 05:11.620
just instead of grabbing the first item I'm going to grab all the links and I'm also grabbing.

05:11.660 --> 05:19.550
I'm going to grab all the votes and all the votes are is going to be soup dot select and then grab what

05:19.550 --> 05:20.300
was it again.

05:20.300 --> 05:21.750
It was the score class.

05:21.860 --> 05:27.830
So I'm going to say grab all the elements that have the score class and just to make sure that this

05:27.830 --> 05:28.520
works.

05:28.570 --> 05:33.770
But let's just say print votes and grab the first item.

05:33.860 --> 05:37.600
So I'm going to run this and look at that.

05:37.600 --> 05:45.670
I have one hundred and eighty points because the first story well let's refresh the page because this

05:45.670 --> 05:47.050
may have changed.

05:47.070 --> 05:47.280
Yeah.

05:47.320 --> 05:52.660
It looks like C this Web site is constantly changing and now has one hundred and eighty two votes.

05:52.660 --> 05:54.820
So if I refresh here there you go.

05:54.820 --> 05:56.800
One hundred and eighty two points.

05:58.530 --> 05:59.380
Awesome.

05:59.400 --> 06:07.710
So we now have grabbed the two pieces of information that we really care about the links and the votes.

06:07.710 --> 06:13.590
And luckily they're all in order because each link the first link and the first vote is together.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.160
The second link and the second vote is together.

06:16.290 --> 06:19.750
So that's useful for us now.

06:19.810 --> 06:25.180
Just as a side note with beautiful soup we can keep chaining these right.

06:25.270 --> 06:33.720
For example I can now say votes dot get and get for example an attribute name.

06:33.760 --> 06:43.990
So for example I can grab a score over here and say Hey grab the score from here so that if I do print

06:43.990 --> 06:50.930
here and I run this well votes is a list.

06:50.930 --> 06:52.940
So we actually have to grab the first element.

06:52.950 --> 07:00.610
So let's just grab the first element run this again and we get none.

07:00.620 --> 07:06.140
Because while this is the value the attribute is I.D..

07:06.140 --> 07:17.510
So if I do get I.D. for example and I run this I now get the actual I.D. value so with beautiful soup

07:17.540 --> 07:22.900
you can keep chaining these we can keep selecting so I can say dot select here if I want.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.730
If we have even more information.

07:24.980 --> 07:27.850
But in our case we have the information that we need.

07:27.890 --> 07:34.640
It's time for us to go to the next step which is to try and combine these and make it more useful.

07:34.640 --> 07:35.980
So let's do that in the next video.
