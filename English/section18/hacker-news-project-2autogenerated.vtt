WEBVTT

00:00.950 --> 00:05.400
So in order to fix this we have to change our strategy.

00:05.480 --> 00:12.230
Instead of grabbing the points we should grab what we call the subtext and the subtext is well what

00:12.230 --> 00:19.730
comes underneath the title because every single title has these subtext and underneath it we have the

00:19.730 --> 00:26.630
score now in our case the top one over here doesn't actually have the score.

00:26.630 --> 00:29.390
You see here that we have the subtext but there is no score.

00:30.020 --> 00:33.800
So what we can do is do a little extra check.

00:34.100 --> 00:41.990
If we go back to our code we can now change this a little bit so that instead of having the votes here

00:43.680 --> 00:51.550
what we can do is grab the subtext and this is going to be the subtext class that we're going to grab

00:51.640 --> 00:56.080
to make sure that all links are going to have the subtext.

00:56.080 --> 01:06.060
So let's select subtext and in here we're going to change our strategy to say that hate the votes that

01:06.060 --> 01:15.340
I want or in our case the vote because we're looping through here is going to equal the subtext at the

01:15.340 --> 01:29.030
place our looping through and we're going to select the class of scores so remember if we scroll down

01:30.010 --> 01:37.350
class of score is what we want and that's going to be our vote.

01:37.360 --> 01:41.570
Now remember there are some cases where the vote won't be there.

01:41.630 --> 01:52.870
So while we can do now is say hey if the vote has no length because remember we're going to get an array

01:54.260 --> 01:58.140
if this length is zero that's going to evaluate to false.

01:58.310 --> 02:03.280
But if it's not zero then I want you to do all of this.

02:03.320 --> 02:11.330
So now our vote instead of doing index here we can just say the vote get tax and replace the points

02:11.510 --> 02:17.150
but it's only going to run if the vote list exists.

02:17.150 --> 02:18.300
So let's test this out.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.070
I'm going to run

02:22.290 --> 02:26.070
and we have to change our parameters from votes here to subtext.

02:26.070 --> 02:26.920
So let's do that.

02:26.940 --> 02:37.090
Let's say subtext subtext Phi save and run this again we get list object has no actually get taxed because

02:37.120 --> 02:42.910
again we get an array here so we have to grab the first element in the array.

02:42.910 --> 02:44.860
Remember because we're grabbing the subtext.

02:44.860 --> 02:53.490
So if I run this again all right it looks like we finally have our points and no errors.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.070
That's awesome.

02:55.770 --> 03:00.900
So you see here when you're web scraping you're testing out your assumptions and maybe you make some

03:00.900 --> 03:06.090
mistakes so you want to adjust and fix them based on what the Web site does.

03:06.180 --> 03:14.020
Now in here the last thing I want to do is to actually add the vote into our hacker news point here.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.600
So let's remove the print here

03:19.230 --> 03:20.520
and I'm going to add

03:25.280 --> 03:25.850
votes

03:28.720 --> 03:32.110
as the well the points that we get here.

03:32.110 --> 03:33.250
Let's make this a little smaller.

03:33.250 --> 03:37.020
Just so you can see perfect.

03:37.090 --> 03:39.640
So we have this how can you spend.

03:39.640 --> 03:44.520
So let's test it up now before I show you I want to show you something.

03:44.530 --> 03:49.940
When it comes to enumerate why did we use enumerate.

03:49.950 --> 03:56.400
Well it's because in here we have two lists the links and the subtext.

03:56.550 --> 04:03.270
And we're only renew my rating over the links list and subtext.

04:03.300 --> 04:05.190
What is now being enumerated.

04:05.190 --> 04:13.140
So what happens here is we need the index so that we can access this subtext within our loop because

04:13.140 --> 04:20.480
otherwise well if we didn't enumerate there's no way to grab both links and subtext items.

04:20.850 --> 04:25.230
So for example in here my links can just be converted to item

04:28.220 --> 04:36.250
item but subtext so we'll just have to use the index that we have here hopefully that makes sense.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.660
Now let's print this and see what it looks like.

04:39.810 --> 04:46.190
I'm going to print hit save and let's run our script

04:49.080 --> 04:54.500
and we have a little mistake here we got to make sure that the curly brackets are outside.

04:54.890 --> 05:01.680
If I run this all right we see that we get our data and let's just check.

05:01.680 --> 05:07.240
We have title about security issues on TLC which has a vote of 3 0 7.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.050
Let's just check that on the page.

05:09.190 --> 05:17.410
If I scroll down about the security issue on TLC which has three hundred and seven votes.

05:17.410 --> 05:17.750
Awesome.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.930
So this seems to be working our script is working.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.810
Wonderful Now the last thing I want to add here is this whole printing is a little ugly.

05:28.910 --> 05:32.960
And ideally we can print things nicely to the terminal.

05:32.990 --> 05:41.300
Well we have a module a built in module that we can use in Python called Pretty print.

05:41.300 --> 05:46.050
And we can just import it like this P print now.

05:46.050 --> 05:47.040
Check this out.

05:47.370 --> 05:56.030
If instead of print here I do p print dot P print.

05:56.070 --> 06:02.150
Let's see if we notice a difference.

06:02.210 --> 06:03.050
All right.

06:03.050 --> 06:04.560
It's a little neater now.

06:04.610 --> 06:09.940
We have a little bit of more spacing and while it's a lot cleaner than it was before.

06:09.950 --> 06:10.780
That's really nice.

06:11.820 --> 06:19.380
Now the other thing is as we mentioned we only care about the votes that have over 100 so let's add

06:19.380 --> 06:20.560
another if statement here.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.490
Let's make this a little bit bigger.

06:22.770 --> 06:27.970
And within the points here we'll just say if points

06:30.630 --> 06:38.340
are higher than ninety nine then we'll append to our updated hacker news.

06:38.550 --> 06:40.470
Let's save give this a go

06:43.580 --> 06:44.060
all right.

06:44.060 --> 06:50.260
It looks like we only have stories that have over 100 points so it's nice and clean.

06:50.270 --> 06:51.270
A lot smaller now.

06:51.650 --> 06:53.490
Awesome.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.690
Now there's a few more things I want to add to this.

06:55.690 --> 07:02.020
Ideally these votes are ranked so we have the highest vote at the top and at the bottom the lowest vote

07:03.210 --> 07:07.310
this way it's easier for me to decide what story I should read first.

07:07.650 --> 07:09.780
Let's explore that in the next video by.
