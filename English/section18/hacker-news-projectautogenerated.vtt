WEBVTT

00:00.890 --> 00:01.860
Welcome back.

00:01.880 --> 00:05.210
We have our data but it's still kind of dirty.

00:05.210 --> 00:07.180
I mean we haven't really filtered.

00:07.180 --> 00:10.280
I only care about the stories with over 100 votes.

00:10.430 --> 00:15.020
And we also want a pretty way to display them.

00:15.020 --> 00:16.520
So let's work on that.

00:16.520 --> 00:26.060
I want to create a function and we'll call it create custom Hacker News and this create custom Hacker

00:26.060 --> 00:36.540
News is going to receive links and votes which we have about over here now in here.

00:36.790 --> 00:44.630
What we're going to do is we're going to create a new Hacker News list that is empty to start off with.

00:44.740 --> 00:52.660
And for now all I want to do is return the hacker news list.

00:52.660 --> 01:00.430
But within this list I only want to add the text and none of the ACM out.

01:00.610 --> 01:03.840
So for example for the links we only care about the title.

01:03.910 --> 01:05.280
So how can we do that.

01:05.380 --> 01:07.600
We want to loop through some things.

01:07.630 --> 01:12.850
What we're going to do is say for and we'll use enumerate here.

01:12.850 --> 01:21.160
So we're gonna have an index and then an item and in here we're going to enumerate.

01:21.260 --> 01:26.180
Remember we've seen the innumerate before which gives us an index as well.

01:26.180 --> 01:30.490
And we're going to enumerate the links and I'll show you why we want to enumerate.

01:30.500 --> 01:41.680
And the second so in here I want to grab the title of each link by simply doing this.

01:41.700 --> 01:51.910
We're going to say link of index or less changes to idea X. That's a little nicer.

01:51.910 --> 02:00.980
So we're going to grab the index of each link and we can use something in beautiful soup called get

02:01.330 --> 02:02.210
taxed.

02:02.360 --> 02:07.750
And this is going to get the text inside of the tech and just to get us started on this.

02:07.760 --> 02:15.090
I'm going to just simply say Hacker News dot append and add to the list the title so let's see what

02:15.090 --> 02:20.400
happens when I call this I'm going to say create custom Hacker News I'm gonna pass it the links and

02:20.400 --> 02:21.570
the votes.

02:21.960 --> 02:28.030
So let's save run this and it looks like I cannot spell enumerate here.

02:28.030 --> 02:33.620
So let's fix that should be a new merit with E.

02:33.630 --> 02:36.060
Let's try that again.

02:36.100 --> 02:37.090
All right.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.780
No errors but we want to ideally print this.

02:39.790 --> 02:41.230
So let's just say

02:44.590 --> 02:45.780
and see what we get.

02:45.810 --> 02:49.070
I'm going to run this.

02:49.150 --> 02:49.860
All right.

02:49.990 --> 02:50.540
Look at that.

02:50.620 --> 02:57.880
We have all of the texts the titles of our links.

02:57.910 --> 02:58.360
That's great.

02:59.700 --> 02:59.950
OK.

02:59.970 --> 03:03.420
But these titles are useless without a link.

03:03.420 --> 03:04.190
Right.

03:04.200 --> 03:13.080
And if you remember a link in an HMO is defined with what we call an H ref.

03:13.160 --> 03:22.010
This H ref attribute is the link that we can click to go to the next page or to the page of this title

03:22.960 --> 03:28.310
so we can also grab that and we can call it H ref.

03:28.540 --> 03:39.310
And this is going to equal lengths index and this time around we don't want to get the text.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.710
We want to get the attribute right.

03:41.820 --> 03:50.430
So we can actually say dot get and then grab the H ref and just in case there are no H refs or maybe

03:50.430 --> 03:56.750
the link is broken we can give a default in the second parameter and I'll just say not so that.

03:56.820 --> 04:05.530
Now this hack can use append if we just append let's say this time the H ref and I run this look at

04:05.530 --> 04:08.340
that we have all the links on the page.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.150
That's awesome.

04:09.790 --> 04:12.660
But how can we combine the title and a draft now.

04:13.390 --> 04:16.180
Well this should be fairly simple right.

04:16.210 --> 04:17.670
We can use a dictionary.

04:17.770 --> 04:26.680
So in our list we can append a dictionary that has the title which will be the title that we have here

04:27.950 --> 04:38.110
and then also have the link that will be the H ref right over here.

04:38.150 --> 04:42.750
So here now we'll have a dictionary with title and link.

04:42.950 --> 04:48.100
So if I save and run this again.

04:48.220 --> 04:56.700
Look at that we have a dictionary that has a link and also a title awesome.

04:56.790 --> 05:04.110
So we grab the information that we need we grab the link and the text none of the other stuff matters

05:04.110 --> 05:04.580
to us.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.830
But we still have the votes.

05:06.910 --> 05:08.130
So how can we do that.

05:10.530 --> 05:11.270
The votes.

05:11.310 --> 05:16.580
Well we can create a variable or instead of votes just to distinguish it from this.

05:16.590 --> 05:22.290
Let's just say points and points is going to be.

05:22.570 --> 05:23.850
Well what we're going to do.

05:23.860 --> 05:28.470
We're going to grab the votes index.

05:28.500 --> 05:35.460
Remember we're looping through this and we're simply going to say get taxed.

05:35.550 --> 05:46.080
Now let's see what we get initially when we do get taxed so in here I'm just going to print points and

05:46.080 --> 05:46.700
see what we get.

05:46.980 --> 05:53.660
And I'm going to remove the print from here just so we can focus on the points for now so I'm going

05:53.660 --> 05:57.850
to save and run.

05:57.860 --> 05:58.460
All right.

05:58.580 --> 05:59.560
We get an error.

05:59.630 --> 06:05.560
We get all these points but it looks like I get an error saying list index out of range.

06:05.780 --> 06:11.810
And this is a little gotcha that you're going to have to sometimes debug when scraping Web sites.

06:11.870 --> 06:17.840
But essentially what happened here is there is a story and this is a special one that actually doesn't

06:17.840 --> 06:22.530
have any votes which is very rare on the front page of Hacker News.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.240
But this one over here doesn't have any votes.

06:25.250 --> 06:32.570
So essentially what it's saying is I never grabbed the scores the points of this.

06:32.660 --> 06:38.000
So we have technically more links than we have votes.

06:38.120 --> 06:42.320
So by the time we get to the to the last link here.

06:42.410 --> 06:45.950
Well the list of votes is one less.

06:45.950 --> 06:52.160
So it's going to say hey I'm trying to grab the votes at the very end but there's no more votes.

06:52.160 --> 06:58.550
This list is shorter than the links list so we can just do a quick check here to make sure that when

06:58.550 --> 07:04.740
we grab these things that we only care about stories with votes.

07:04.790 --> 07:11.030
And luckily for us this is why we want to check if a story is more than 100 points the way we're going

07:11.030 --> 07:12.070
to do that.

07:12.230 --> 07:15.260
We're going to add an if statement right here.

07:15.500 --> 07:21.740
Now before we add the if statement we actually want to convert this into a number so we can say hey

07:21.800 --> 07:32.630
if a story has more than 100 points then we want to keep it and appended to our new how can use.

07:32.630 --> 07:42.290
So the first thing we want to do is to simply say that we want to convert this into an int but we also

07:42.290 --> 07:51.500
want to replace the points here the space points into well nothing so we can use the dot replace method

07:52.370 --> 08:00.960
and simply say hey anytime you see space points which is what we see over here I want you to replace

08:00.960 --> 08:04.110
that with just an empty string.

08:04.140 --> 08:11.310
So this is going to return for us a string that is a number and then convert it into an integer.

08:11.340 --> 08:22.300
So let's test it at let's close a bracket here hit safe and run our script and there you go.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.880
We have our numbers.

08:23.920 --> 08:24.400
That's great.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.760
But again we still have this error.

08:26.800 --> 08:27.880
So what can we do here.
