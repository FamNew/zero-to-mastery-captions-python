You have just learned the basics of web scraping.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.540
It's pretty exciting isn't it.

00:06.570 --> 00:09.960
A lot of power at your hands at your fingertips.

00:10.260 --> 00:15.720
But let's say you want to go further learn more maybe become a professional web scraper.

00:15.720 --> 00:16.170
I don't know.

00:16.230 --> 00:21.670
Maybe that's why you wanted to do what are some things that I would recommend.

00:21.670 --> 00:24.630
Well get more familiar with beautiful soup.

00:25.360 --> 00:32.130
But keep in mind what I said at the beginning of this section ideally you don't even have to web scrape.

00:32.150 --> 00:39.910
Ideally you can use an API maybe the Web site that you want to get data from actually gives you an API.

00:40.100 --> 00:51.490
For example if I go to air B and B API you can see that SBB has announced an official API so we can

00:51.490 --> 00:55.000
actually perhaps read about what data.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.390
Air B and B just gives us access to and that should be your first stop.

01:00.460 --> 01:04.500
Maybe if you don't have that then you'll look at beautiful soup.

01:04.690 --> 01:09.430
The next thing you might want to look at is this framework called scrappy.

01:09.430 --> 01:17.110
Think of it as beautiful soup but with a lot more features a framework is essentially an entire kitchen

01:17.150 --> 01:25.330
and an entire tool belt that you can use to scrape Web sites and you use things like scrappy when you

01:25.570 --> 01:31.900
want to scrape massive web sites massive amounts of data a framework versus a library.

01:31.930 --> 01:33.670
Is that a framework.

01:33.670 --> 01:37.630
Almost it teaches a new language in itself.

01:37.630 --> 01:44.170
It gives you all the tools necessary to do everything that you want when it comes to scraping data.

01:44.170 --> 01:46.910
Beautiful Soup on the other hand is smaller.

01:46.960 --> 01:47.710
It's a library.

01:47.710 --> 01:52.060
So gives you a few nifty tools to do small things like what we've done here.

01:52.240 --> 01:57.770
Scrappy the framework well is an entire thing in itself.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.380
You can go through their documentation and tutorial.

02:00.380 --> 02:05.960
It takes a bit of time to get used to but if you want to do this maybe full time scrappy it's something

02:05.960 --> 02:07.700
that you should take a look.

02:07.730 --> 02:11.660
Finally what do you do with all this data.

02:11.660 --> 02:19.100
Eventually you might want to do something maybe store it in a text file in a CSP file something that

02:19.100 --> 02:22.130
we've talked about and we'll talk about in the course.

02:22.130 --> 02:28.370
But as he collected more and more data maybe using something like scrappy you might want to start looking

02:28.370 --> 02:36.560
into using what we call databases and databases allow us to store massive amounts of data and save it

02:36.770 --> 02:40.360
somewhere so that we can access it whenever we want.

02:40.520 --> 02:47.600
And there's a ton of databases something that is beyond the goal of this course but you may have heard

02:47.600 --> 02:54.210
of things like Mongo D.B. readies my Eskew El post Chris.

02:54.210 --> 03:01.830
These are all ways to store data store massive amounts of data and access it so you might want to learn

03:01.830 --> 03:10.770
about how to use a framework like scrappy and collect that data and store it somewhere on a database

03:11.340 --> 03:14.800
so that other people on your team can maybe access it.

03:14.820 --> 03:21.030
The possibilities are endless but if there's one thing that you're gonna take away from this is please

03:21.030 --> 03:27.380
be nice be ethical and don't do anything illegal because while I don't want to get in trouble and I'm

03:27.390 --> 03:30.600
sure you don't as well I'll see in the next one.

03:30.800 --> 03:31.020
Baba.
