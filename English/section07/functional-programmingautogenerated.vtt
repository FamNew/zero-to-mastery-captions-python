00:00.790 --> 00:08.920
Now we learned that as programmers we started to write code that was just pure procedural code to something

00:08.920 --> 00:13.560
more organized using something like object oriented programming.

00:13.600 --> 00:21.340
And we talked about how we had languages like Smalltalk that had this concept of classes and objects

00:21.550 --> 00:28.490
to organize our code into these functional boxes now around the same time.

00:28.570 --> 00:36.320
There were also this idea of a another paradigm called functional programming and languages like Scheme

00:36.620 --> 00:40.480
introduced this idea of functional programming.

00:40.490 --> 00:46.940
Now remember a paradigm is a way for us to think about our code and organize our code.

00:47.030 --> 00:50.710
And up until this point we learned about object oriented programming.

00:50.870 --> 00:55.540
In the next couple of videos I want to tackle this idea of functional programming.

00:55.560 --> 01:01.500
Now some of the concepts are different than object oriented programming but that doesn't mean that you

01:01.500 --> 01:06.050
have to pick one or the other or one is better than the other.

01:06.060 --> 01:13.200
Instead we can use the concepts from both to think like programmers and understand that there's tradeoffs

01:13.260 --> 01:14.900
pros and cons to each.

01:14.940 --> 01:18.520
And we're gonna try and explore that over the next couple of videos.

01:18.690 --> 01:23.260
So what is functional programming let's find out.
