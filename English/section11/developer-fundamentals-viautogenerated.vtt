Let's get into another developer fundamental and that is pros and cons of libraries.

00:06.750 --> 00:13.440
You want to be careful with packages because it's not always good to use them.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.270
Now what do I mean by that.

00:15.270 --> 00:20.430
Well these packages are created by developers and programmers.

00:20.430 --> 00:25.410
You can have people that are creating really really good packages but also people that are creating

00:25.770 --> 00:29.570
bad packages that may be buggy and don't work well.

00:29.640 --> 00:36.180
So you have to develop that skill to make sure you're able to see hey this package is really popular

00:36.210 --> 00:43.590
or this package is being maintained or this library is really popular with the community so most likely

00:43.710 --> 00:45.540
it's a good package to use.

00:45.540 --> 00:52.900
So this is a skill that you need to develop also keep in mind that every time you add a library to let's

00:52.900 --> 00:59.110
say your project you're adding more and more code which means more and more bytes of data.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.720
So your project gets heavier and heavier and heavier.

01:02.830 --> 01:08.350
So that's also something that you want to consider before you're importing a library ask yourself this

01:08.350 --> 01:10.750
could I just write this myself.

01:10.750 --> 01:16.930
You usually want to pull in a library when writing something from scratch yourself is going to be really

01:16.930 --> 01:20.740
time consuming and you don't have the expertise in that area.

01:20.740 --> 01:25.390
At the same time it's what makes programming so powerful.

01:25.390 --> 01:25.910
Right.

01:25.930 --> 01:29.170
Because we don't have to start everything from scratch.

01:29.170 --> 01:35.650
And most of the time when you're working as a developer what you're doing is essentially matching and

01:35.950 --> 01:40.600
pulling in different libraries and getting them to all work together.

01:40.600 --> 01:46.000
A lot of your work is going to involve working with these libraries reading the documentation of these

01:46.000 --> 01:52.900
libraries and figuring things out as you go as you try and build a useful tool by combining everything

01:52.900 --> 01:53.930
together.

01:53.950 --> 01:56.260
So there's pros and cons to everything.

01:56.890 --> 02:00.840
And this is just something that you will develop as you progress to your career.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.170
Just keep an open mind.

02:02.200 --> 02:10.070
Be careful of using just any library but also learn to read library documentation learn how to use all

02:10.070 --> 02:15.480
these different tools to combine to create something useful I'll see in the next video.

02:15.630 --> 02:15.860
Bob.
