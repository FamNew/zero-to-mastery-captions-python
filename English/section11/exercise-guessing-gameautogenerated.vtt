00:00.780 --> 00:01.290
Welcome back.

00:01.830 --> 00:03.960
How did you do with the random game.

00:04.110 --> 00:06.010
Were you able to solve it.

00:06.090 --> 00:06.800
Let's give it a try.

00:06.790 --> 00:08.600
Here now.

00:08.630 --> 00:10.870
I'm just going to use the test stockpile.

00:10.940 --> 00:18.880
Actually let's just rename it just so it's not confusing I'm going to rename it to random not random

00:19.150 --> 00:27.200
random game by all right now in here I want to be able to first of all.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.810
Well let's think about what we need.

00:29.870 --> 00:42.850
So the first thing we need is to generate a number one through 10 then while we need to do next is to

00:42.910 --> 00:45.170
get an input from user.

00:45.210 --> 00:45.560
Right.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.350
And then we want to do some sort of an input check.

00:48.370 --> 01:04.240
So let's say check that input is a number one through ten and then check if if number is the right guess.

01:04.380 --> 01:08.550
Otherwise ask again.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.120
So that seems like a good program that we can write.

01:12.150 --> 01:14.200
So how can we do this.

01:14.250 --> 01:17.840
Well the first task is to generate a number one to 10.

01:17.940 --> 01:25.620
I know that I'm definitely going to want to import the random library from here and specifically there

01:25.620 --> 01:26.070
Rand.

01:26.070 --> 01:32.370
And so I can just say from random import Rand and which we've seen.

01:32.700 --> 01:34.650
And here I can generate the numbers.

01:34.770 --> 01:43.580
So let's call it the answer is going to be Rand and from 1 to 10.

01:43.610 --> 01:51.480
So this is going to be our machine generated random number that we need to try and guess next is we

01:51.480 --> 01:53.390
have to get the input from the user.

01:53.460 --> 01:54.760
So how can we do this.

01:54.870 --> 01:56.390
Well simple right.

01:56.460 --> 02:01.530
We can get a guess as input from the user and we get the prompt.

02:01.530 --> 02:08.600
So we'll say guess a number one through 10 all right.

02:08.600 --> 02:09.500
So that's looking good.

02:09.500 --> 02:12.880
What about check that input that it's a number one to 10.

02:13.040 --> 02:21.780
So we have to do a bit of checking here now because we want to keep looping while the user is guessing.

02:21.860 --> 02:26.740
I'm going to do a while True loop that we have to make sure we break out of.

02:26.750 --> 02:34.100
So we don't have an infinite loop and in the first part of the while loop I want to check what the user

02:34.100 --> 02:35.440
inputs.

02:35.450 --> 02:39.210
So I'm going to say if guess.

02:39.370 --> 02:44.180
Well we know right away that the input is going to give us a string.

02:44.260 --> 02:47.680
So we have to make sure we convert this into an end first.

02:47.710 --> 02:48.570
So let's do that.

02:48.580 --> 02:49.450
I'm going to say

02:52.330 --> 03:08.300
Aunt gas is greater than 1 and it guess is less than eleven.

03:08.390 --> 03:13.670
So in our case let's do zero here because we want to make sure that if it's one it's still good if it's

03:13.670 --> 03:17.390
10 it's still good in that case.

03:17.510 --> 03:22.940
Well we can actually try and check if it's the right guess.

03:23.040 --> 03:27.570
Now what happens if this fails.

03:27.600 --> 03:32.580
What if the user enters a string that can't be turned into an end.

03:32.880 --> 03:39.870
For example if I go to my terminal here and I just turn on the Python interpreter and say it and then

03:39.870 --> 03:47.550
just give it some gibberish I get a value Error Invalid literal for int with base 10 I have no idea

03:47.550 --> 03:48.460
what you're trying to do.

03:48.570 --> 03:51.490
So we can check for a value error here.

03:51.520 --> 03:55.630
So what I'm going to say is to try

03:58.740 --> 04:03.210
this bit of code and for now we'll just pass in here.

04:03.210 --> 04:12.570
And if for some reason it doesn't pass and we'll check for value error then I'm going to print Please

04:12.930 --> 04:13.950
enter a

04:16.790 --> 04:19.960
a number awesome.

04:20.120 --> 04:29.060
So we're checking that the input is a number one to 10 so for now just to make sure that this is working.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.050
Let's just do this.

04:30.170 --> 04:41.630
Let's break out of this loop for print all good in here and break out of this loop considering that

04:42.560 --> 04:45.680
right now we're entering a number one to 10.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.330
Let's just make this a little bit smaller.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.620
Just so you can see it better.

04:48.620 --> 04:58.260
There you go and for here we'll just do continue because we'll just keep looping until well until we

04:58.260 --> 04:59.860
get the right answer.

04:59.880 --> 05:07.530
So again we're importing Rand and generating some random number one to 10 we're getting the guess from

05:07.530 --> 05:08.320
the user.

05:08.490 --> 05:11.430
And then we want to check that the input is a number one to ten.

05:11.460 --> 05:20.000
So I have a loop that I'm going to keep running and I'm going to ask is the number zero to eleven if

05:20.000 --> 05:21.600
it is then we're all good.

05:21.650 --> 05:26.540
If for some reason we get a valuer then we're going to say hey please enter a number.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.070
So let's just test that up.

05:28.460 --> 05:31.370
I'm going to go to my terminal or actually we can just run this here.

05:31.460 --> 05:34.360
Let's run it all right.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.490
Yes a number one to 10

05:40.050 --> 05:41.890
and I get all good.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.330
I think we need a couple of spaces here.

05:44.330 --> 05:45.660
It looks a little weird.

05:45.740 --> 05:51.290
So let's just say Guess a number want to 10 and get some spaces.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.850
Let's run that again.

05:53.850 --> 05:54.360
There you go.

05:54.360 --> 06:02.430
And I've actually already noticed in a bug that we need to fix if let's say I enter gibberish oh boy

06:03.270 --> 06:09.830
God Please enter a number please enter a number and we need to stop this because it's going to get destroyed

06:11.370 --> 06:11.540
right.

06:11.540 --> 06:14.760
So what happened here.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.910
Well we didn't break out of this loop.

06:17.910 --> 06:24.560
We continued and we just kept going wall to wall to wall through and we kept getting a value error.

06:24.580 --> 06:26.810
So you have to be careful here.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.810
Remember when we continue.

06:28.950 --> 06:33.960
It goes back to the try block or what back to the while loop and it's going to try this again but we're

06:33.960 --> 06:37.170
not asking for the input or a new input again.

06:37.170 --> 06:41.660
This is going to fail and then another value happens and then this is going to fail another valley error

06:41.670 --> 06:42.360
happens.

06:42.450 --> 06:44.580
So we need to put the gas

06:47.350 --> 06:51.830
inside here right inside of the tribe block.

06:51.860 --> 07:01.070
So now if I run this all right let's get the number let's give gibberish I got hey please enter a number.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.690
All right we'll enter a number will.

07:03.260 --> 07:04.290
We'll enter.

07:04.290 --> 07:06.660
How about zero.

07:06.820 --> 07:07.040
No.

07:07.250 --> 07:13.720
This doesn't work it's going to keep asking me because well the number that we entered.

07:13.730 --> 07:16.900
It's less than 1 to 10 but it's a wrong answer.

07:16.910 --> 07:18.940
We could check is wrong you know.

07:18.980 --> 07:19.400
Let's do that.

07:19.400 --> 07:26.490
Let's say else we'll say Hey Bozo.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.060
I said 1 to 10.

07:29.670 --> 07:30.680
I'll be a fun one.

07:30.690 --> 07:35.230
All right let's run this let's do zero.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.830
Hey Bozo I said I want to 10.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.880
All right let's do five

07:41.640 --> 07:42.970
I guess the number want to 10.

07:42.990 --> 07:44.130
Everything's good.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.040
All good.

07:46.050 --> 07:46.710
All right.

07:46.770 --> 07:54.940
So now what I'm going to do is just see if the guess matches whatever the answer right here is.

07:55.110 --> 08:01.220
Now before I do that you see here how the pie chart I.D. gives me a little hint.

08:01.260 --> 08:06.660
A yellow line that says hey this simplified chain comparison can actually be improved.

08:06.660 --> 08:09.090
It's why ideas are so powerful.

08:09.090 --> 08:11.380
And here I can actually simplify this.

08:11.460 --> 08:26.320
I can say if it guess is higher than zero and less than 11 then do this and look at that.

08:26.320 --> 08:32.080
I just simplify my code and the editor gave me a nice hint OK.

08:32.110 --> 08:34.390
Let's go through here.

08:34.450 --> 08:42.760
So instead of saying print all good let's say if this is the case we're going to have another conditional

08:43.320 --> 09:07.750
and say if the end gets equals to the answer we'll print your a genius and we'll break out of that now.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.430
Notice here how we're doing it.

09:09.590 --> 09:16.910
Guess a couple of times maybe a better way of doing it is to just do an end here so we don't repeat

09:16.910 --> 09:24.290
ourself and run the same function over and over and just have guests like this.

09:24.370 --> 09:29.200
So again we're cleaning up our code making it read more like English.

09:29.200 --> 09:36.550
That's nice and now if we run this guy say no let's say five.

09:36.590 --> 09:42.080
No that's not right let's do six seven eight nine.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.460
Guy's a tough cookie.

09:43.460 --> 09:47.940
One two three four.

09:48.010 --> 09:50.780
Oh come on is it 10 Wow.

09:50.840 --> 09:57.830
We are definitely not geniuses because we just ball tried 10 times but this looks like it's working.

09:58.070 --> 10:05.250
Let's make sure that we're actually working this properly by cheating a little bit.

10:05.290 --> 10:16.080
I'm going to actually print out here the answer so I see what the answer is before I type it in.

10:16.120 --> 10:20.740
Let's do that actually right here five click Run.

10:20.740 --> 10:20.950
All right.

10:20.950 --> 10:26.530
The numbers for if I type in for all right now I'm a genius first right.

10:26.530 --> 10:29.270
All right we're cheating but it looks like this is working.

10:29.290 --> 10:31.150
That's pretty cool.

10:31.180 --> 10:38.590
Now the last part here is that up until now I've used the input but I said I wanted to run it in a terminal

10:39.630 --> 10:44.520
and I want to be able to actually well give it parameters right.

10:44.640 --> 10:51.750
We give it the start parameter and the end parameter of randomness so we can make the game as hard as

10:51.750 --> 10:54.540
we want so that's pretty simple.

10:54.550 --> 11:04.680
We have the import system here and we simply say sis dot our GV the first parameter.

11:04.680 --> 11:11.900
Remember the first one is going to be the file name and then the third parameter and that's going to

11:11.900 --> 11:13.880
be the numbers that we giving it.

11:14.570 --> 11:17.370
So let's use this file now.

11:17.600 --> 11:23.960
Let's copy the code and just for this example because it's simpler we'll just add it to our Sublime

11:23.960 --> 11:29.420
Text file and looks like we have to do six dot ARG V here as well.

11:29.420 --> 11:31.370
Make sure we don't forget that.

11:31.630 --> 11:36.390
So let's fix that as well like that.

11:36.430 --> 11:37.600
That's better.

11:37.610 --> 11:44.620
And if we run this not int because remember the parameters that we're gonna give it are going to be

11:44.620 --> 11:45.820
turned into strings.

11:45.880 --> 11:53.030
So we just have to make sure that we convert this into an int like this.

11:53.060 --> 12:00.720
Now if we just copy this run this over here let's run it again.

12:00.720 --> 12:07.110
So I'm pressing up here because I remember as my previous command let's give that I go gets a number

12:07.530 --> 12:09.430
one or two let's go with one.

12:09.450 --> 12:10.060
There you go.

12:10.080 --> 12:18.330
I'm a genius and our program is now working our guessing game is now working very very cool.

12:18.330 --> 12:24.390
If you've got this good job if you did it well you can just take a look my code and hopefully see where

12:24.390 --> 12:26.200
you went wrong.

12:26.220 --> 12:27.390
Good job getting this far.

12:27.570 --> 12:29.020
I'll see in the next one by.
