00:00.480 --> 00:01.230
Welcome back.

00:02.220 --> 00:08.700
I just found this python package pie jokes and mind you I have never installed this so I'm going to

00:08.700 --> 00:13.560
try and do this from scratch so you can see what the steps would be like.

00:13.560 --> 00:16.320
So this is a completely useless package.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.230
It looks like it gives us one line jokes for programmers.

00:19.260 --> 00:21.380
So I think this will be appropriate.

00:21.390 --> 00:25.230
I also like the fact that it has GitHub stars.

00:25.230 --> 00:33.360
So here sometimes some of these packages have are hosted on github and get hub is essentially a social

00:33.360 --> 00:41.160
network for programmers you're able to put up your code up here and people can be your code and download

00:41.170 --> 00:48.830
it and a good measure of how popular a package is is usually something like stars or forks because stars

00:48.830 --> 00:54.530
are given by people that really like the package or fork is people who copy the package and use it in

00:54.530 --> 00:58.050
their own coding maybe on their own get how profiles.

00:58.100 --> 01:03.770
So this looks like a very simple library so let's let's install it.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.100
So there's several ways that we can actually install this package.

01:07.100 --> 01:11.630
You can see here that the command is pip install pi jokes but I want to show you first how it works

01:11.630 --> 01:19.560
with PI charm and then show you how to do it with the command line so I have pi charm over here.

01:19.600 --> 01:25.450
We have some relics of our old project now in here in PI charm.

01:25.450 --> 01:32.080
Again it's an idea so comes with a lot of built in things I can do PI charm preferences and then simply

01:32.080 --> 01:41.090
go to project modules I can go to project interpreter and then here I see that this interpreter has

01:41.090 --> 01:43.370
some modules already pre installed.

01:43.370 --> 01:48.080
I see that I have Pip but all I need to do is click on the plus sign here.

01:48.140 --> 01:55.950
If I click plus I can actually hear search for packages so these are all the available packages that

01:55.950 --> 01:56.750
we have.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.580
So what was our thing called again pi jokes.

01:59.580 --> 02:04.680
All right let's search for Pi jokes pi jokes.

02:04.740 --> 02:06.390
There it is.

02:06.490 --> 02:11.980
I think it was this one with zero point five with the author pi joke society just making sure that it's

02:11.980 --> 02:15.220
the same one yep.

02:15.310 --> 02:17.680
Author of Pi joke society.

02:17.680 --> 02:23.540
So all we need to do here is to simply install package.

02:23.550 --> 02:24.150
There you go.

02:24.150 --> 02:26.870
Pi jokes installed successfully.

02:26.920 --> 02:32.220
So now that I have pi jokes here let's have a look at how we can use it.

02:32.380 --> 02:35.910
By the way I can actually test to see that I have this installed.

02:35.910 --> 02:44.320
If I go to lip Python three point seven site packages there's my PI jokes distribution.

02:44.320 --> 02:47.820
Awesome so let's see how we can use it again.

02:47.830 --> 02:51.180
I've actually never used this before so let's have a look.

02:51.200 --> 02:55.090
You can also access jokes in your own project by importing pi jokes.

02:55.100 --> 02:55.490
All right.

02:55.520 --> 03:02.010
Let me just copy that and using the function get joke and get jokes.

03:02.010 --> 03:03.010
All right sounds simple enough.

03:03.020 --> 03:04.400
Let's give that a go.

03:04.400 --> 03:12.170
I'm going to import pi jokes like that an animal is the function the function was get joke.

03:12.340 --> 03:16.570
So let's do pie jokes and say Get

03:20.260 --> 03:25.790
joke and I can see that I can give it a language and category.

03:25.900 --> 03:36.170
So let's say get joke here so string is English so let's do we want the joke in english and category.

03:36.240 --> 03:40.080
Let's see it says we can do neutral what are the options here.

03:40.110 --> 03:45.560
Neutral is neutral geek jokes no adult jokes for us we can do Chuck Norris jokes.

03:45.570 --> 03:46.070
All right.

03:46.140 --> 03:47.880
Neutral is fine that's the default.

03:47.910 --> 03:49.820
So we actually don't even need to pass anything here.

03:49.830 --> 03:55.520
But just to be safe let's do neutral.

03:55.530 --> 03:57.150
All right let's.

03:57.150 --> 04:00.690
I don't know what it's going to do so let's just run this program and see what happens.

04:01.850 --> 04:02.090
All right.

04:02.120 --> 04:03.710
Let's print out the joke.

04:03.740 --> 04:17.510
Let's say joke equals and then say print joke five like run real programmers can write assembly code

04:17.510 --> 04:21.520
in any language Ha ha ha.

04:21.530 --> 04:22.190
All right.

04:22.260 --> 04:24.110
Here's our completely useless package.

04:24.110 --> 04:24.830
Let's do another one.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.610
We'll see if there's any funny ones.

04:26.900 --> 04:32.180
How to explain the movie Inception to a programmer when you run a VM inside another VM inside another

04:32.180 --> 04:32.540
VM.

04:32.540 --> 04:35.030
Everything runs real slow.

04:35.030 --> 04:35.610
All right.

04:35.690 --> 04:41.300
Some of these jokes I'm sure are pretty funny some of them might be a little bit advanced but hey that's

04:41.300 --> 04:42.370
actually not bad.

04:42.380 --> 04:45.540
You know what I might use this package in the future I think.

04:45.690 --> 04:47.650
I think this fine but I won't bore you with me.

04:47.660 --> 04:49.470
Keep pressing play I might die.

04:49.490 --> 04:56.270
I might not record for a few hours and just waste time reading these these jokes but I just wanted to

04:56.270 --> 05:00.220
show the process of how I would go about doing something like this.

05:01.270 --> 05:09.920
Now most programmers that don't use pi charm instead of doing what I did will most likely use let's

05:09.920 --> 05:13.340
say their terminal to actually do this.

05:13.340 --> 05:17.950
So I have my sublime text here and my terminal or a command prompt.

05:17.990 --> 05:26.270
If you're on Windows right here and if I do present working directory again this is a Linux and Mac

05:26.300 --> 05:31.460
command so I see I'm on the desktop which is where what might 1.0 PI follows.

05:31.520 --> 05:40.030
Now if I wanted to use the PI jokes in here and I click Run.

05:40.060 --> 05:50.820
So let's say Python 3 1.0 pi module not found no module named pi jokes.

05:50.980 --> 05:58.720
That's not good but that's because we installed it for our PI charm environment but not enough for us

05:58.720 --> 06:00.610
to use outside of pie chart.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.560
So how can we do that.

06:02.560 --> 06:10.780
Well we can do Pip to install from the P wide API library or the repository.

06:10.870 --> 06:18.040
So again if I go all the way up you see that I have pip install pi jokes so I can even copy this and

06:18.040 --> 06:21.460
just install it for myself here.

06:21.470 --> 06:22.440
Now here's the thing.

06:22.520 --> 06:25.240
Depending on how you have your machine set up.

06:25.250 --> 06:34.730
If I do Pip dash V with capital V it's going to give me the version of Pip but if you see here that

06:34.730 --> 06:39.650
it says from Python two point seven we want to make sure we're using Python 3.

06:39.710 --> 06:49.260
So in your case if you do Pip three dash v you'll get the right version of Pip so make sure you check

06:49.260 --> 06:54.520
that and make sure that you're using with the Python 3 or higher.

06:54.650 --> 07:01.940
In my case I'll have to call Pip 3 you can always set this up so that Pip refers to the Python 3.

07:02.330 --> 07:08.780
But for now let's say Pip 3 and then we're going to install and here all we say is the package name

07:08.780 --> 07:12.140
we want to install in our case it's the PI jokes package

07:15.740 --> 07:22.460
it's collecting pi jokes successfully installed pi jokes zero point five I also get a little warning

07:22.460 --> 07:25.520
here you're using Pip version nineteen point 0 point 3.

07:25.670 --> 07:32.000
However version nineteen point one is available and you might get this and I always recommend just upgrading.

07:32.000 --> 07:37.520
So I'm just going to copy the command that they give us and I'm going to say pip install upgrade Pip

07:37.870 --> 07:39.980
and I'm gonna do Pip three

07:42.960 --> 07:43.390
right.

07:43.440 --> 07:56.840
So I've successfully updated Pip so again Pip 3 v now House version nineteen point one point one if

07:56.840 --> 08:06.650
I now let's say clear here and do Pip list I see that it shows me all the lists of the packages that

08:06.650 --> 08:16.550
I have and if I scroll up here I see that I have whereas it well I use the PIP man instead of Pip three

08:16.610 --> 08:20.920
solicitor Pip three list.

08:20.950 --> 08:22.900
So there's something that you just have to be careful of.

08:22.930 --> 08:26.050
You can see Pip three list is looking a lot nicer.

08:26.110 --> 08:33.260
Let's see I see that pie jokes is installed awesome.

08:33.470 --> 08:40.410
So now that I have this let's run it so I can run Python 3 and then say 1.0 by

08:43.290 --> 08:46.990
Oh what an appropriate joke I swear I did not time this.

08:47.130 --> 08:53.760
This is just the programming universe telling us something says Friends don't let friends use python

08:53.760 --> 08:56.570
two point seven because hey we should get this joke.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.100
Python 3 is the current and latest.

08:59.310 --> 08:59.810
That's funny.

08:59.820 --> 09:01.560
That's actually a I'm pretty please.

09:01.560 --> 09:05.970
I feel like we should end the video here because this is this is just perfect.

09:06.120 --> 09:06.610
All right.

09:06.690 --> 09:15.270
This is how you install packages with P IP we are able to really use the power of the developers all

09:15.270 --> 09:21.780
around the world using just the simple comment pip or PIP 3 install and whatever package we want across

09:21.780 --> 09:26.220
the world across the Internet we have access to in our projects.

09:26.220 --> 09:27.910
I'll see you in the next one by.
