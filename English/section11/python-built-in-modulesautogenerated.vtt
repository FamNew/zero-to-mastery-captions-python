00:00.620 --> 00:08.990
One of the key features of Python is that the core language that we've been learning up until now is

00:09.140 --> 00:10.130
pretty small.

00:10.220 --> 00:15.460
As a matter of fact we've pretty much covered most of Python now.

00:15.470 --> 00:25.040
Python was created in this small tiny package as a feature to keep things simple although you may feel

00:25.040 --> 00:27.550
like you've learned a lot at the end of the day.

00:27.740 --> 00:32.890
It shouldn't have been that bad because there's not a lot of things to memorize.

00:32.900 --> 00:40.480
We also learned how to organize our code so that we have multiple Python files but the reason python

00:40.780 --> 00:49.660
is so popular and it's used in all sorts of industries from big tech companies like Google and Netflix

00:49.840 --> 00:59.140
to Amazon to small projects and people like us who just maybe are single developers building tiny projects.

00:59.140 --> 01:07.000
Python is extremely useful through what we call external modules and packages that is outside of what

01:07.000 --> 01:08.010
we get from Python.

01:08.380 --> 01:18.260
Well we have an entire package system where we can borrow and expand on the Python functionality and

01:18.340 --> 01:23.430
these are called Python's built in modules.

01:23.470 --> 01:24.370
Let me show you what I mean.

01:25.240 --> 01:31.390
If you go to the Python documentation they have the python module index that I'll link to.

01:31.390 --> 01:37.210
And here we have all the modules that Python give us.

01:37.270 --> 01:44.290
Now these modules actually were installed when we downloaded the Python interpreter.

01:44.290 --> 01:50.010
It comes with Python but in order for us to use them we have to import them.

01:51.090 --> 01:54.890
These are the built in modules and they're really really nice.

01:54.930 --> 01:56.700
For example do you want to send.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.240
I don't know.

01:57.240 --> 01:58.230
An email.

01:58.230 --> 02:05.380
Well there's an email module maybe you want to really do some mathematical operations that are complex

02:05.380 --> 02:10.250
while there's a math module for that and there's a module for a lot of things.

02:10.420 --> 02:11.730
Now don't get scared.

02:11.740 --> 02:15.760
This looks like a lot but you're not supposed to memorize any of these.

02:15.760 --> 02:21.400
You just need to know that they exist so that when you're Googling something you can type in Python

02:21.400 --> 02:29.180
built in module and let's say for example you want to build a game say Python built a module game or

02:29.720 --> 02:34.910
graphical user interface and check if the module exists.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.720
I have to say I've probably only used 30 percent of these but they're there for us to gain extra powers

02:42.860 --> 02:44.150
in other languages.

02:44.150 --> 02:47.750
This might be called a standard library.

02:47.750 --> 02:54.470
That is it's a standard library maintained by the Python community members and making sure that these

02:54.470 --> 03:01.490
packages work really really well with Python and that they're built into the language.

03:01.670 --> 03:08.150
So let's learn how to use them and use one of my favorite ones which is called random.

03:08.150 --> 03:16.190
So let's see here if we can find it are random generate pseudo random numbers with various common distributions

03:16.760 --> 03:18.940
and you can read all about it here.

03:19.070 --> 03:19.810
It's a long read.

03:19.820 --> 03:26.490
So let me just show you now the beauty is that we've actually installed this whenever you install Python

03:26.640 --> 03:31.590
on your machine you get access to all the built in module.

03:31.590 --> 03:32.840
The standard library.

03:33.030 --> 03:37.650
So all I have to do is say import random.

03:37.860 --> 03:50.730
And now I have access to random if I run this let's clock run look at that module random from library

03:50.790 --> 03:58.870
frameworks python you see that it's inversions three point seven library python and random dot PI.

03:58.950 --> 04:03.670
This is actually installed on my machine and it should be installed on yours as well.

04:03.780 --> 04:11.070
If you followed along and installed the python library now where is this where you can actually see

04:11.070 --> 04:12.110
it in our picture.

04:13.210 --> 04:19.870
If you go to external libraries here and you open this up you see here that I have the python three

04:19.870 --> 04:27.430
point seven modules and if I scroll down and you go to Python three point seven or whatever your installation

04:27.430 --> 04:33.350
was and scroll all the way down to let's say Ah where is it.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.790
Where is it as you can see there's a lot

04:38.550 --> 04:42.290
here it is random dot PI.

04:42.380 --> 04:44.150
This is installed on our hand sheet.

04:44.210 --> 04:49.930
And if I double click this Google that I have the random variable generator.

04:50.050 --> 04:58.540
And this is the file that allows us to use random and you can see over here that random is a class that

04:58.720 --> 05:03.430
is going to allow us to well use all this functionality and look at that.

05:03.430 --> 05:11.020
It even has this little line that I told you about in the previous video only run this test function.

05:11.020 --> 05:18.490
If this is the main fault run this is probably something that the maintainers of this module whoever

05:18.490 --> 05:25.060
coded this added to say Hey don't run this for anybody else but if for example we're working on this

05:25.090 --> 05:29.950
and we want to run the test function to test that all of these things are working then run that.

05:30.100 --> 05:37.600
But in our case when we use random as users or consumers of module This is never going to run very very

05:37.600 --> 05:38.490
cool.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.350
Now you can see here how many

05:43.770 --> 05:50.590
modules we have and we even have some packages like the e mail package with well a whole ton of things.

05:50.640 --> 05:59.600
So this is already existing in our computer and that's why we have access to import random so let's

05:59.660 --> 06:02.100
learn more about random now.

06:02.150 --> 06:07.130
What I'd like to do usually when I'm importing a library and I don't know what it does is to actually

06:07.130 --> 06:10.070
use the help function that comes with Python.

06:10.490 --> 06:18.800
If I run this you'll see here that I'll get a help message with well all the information and documentation

06:18.860 --> 06:20.870
of what it does.

06:20.870 --> 06:23.000
So it gives you some description.

06:23.120 --> 06:30.020
If you scroll down it shows you some of the code and some of the methods that perhaps we get which is

06:30.290 --> 06:31.450
really really nice.

06:31.490 --> 06:32.940
Let's lower that down.

06:33.230 --> 06:42.960
Another thing that I like to do after perhaps I read the documentation is to do the dir function and

06:43.000 --> 06:50.710
if I click Run and let's actually print that if I click Run.

06:50.920 --> 06:51.550
Here we go.

06:51.550 --> 06:58.940
It shows me all the methods available on this package so I can see all right.

06:58.950 --> 07:05.760
All these things that I have I have ran range sample see that I can use if you're using an idea like

07:05.760 --> 07:06.450
pie chart.

07:06.480 --> 07:14.350
I could just do dot and actually see all these methods as well which is really really nice.

07:14.360 --> 07:23.390
All right let's have some fun with this random module random has randomly a random method so random

07:23.480 --> 07:31.750
dot random is going to give us well let's print it out and find out it's going to give us a random number

07:31.900 --> 07:34.570
between 0 and 1.

07:34.780 --> 07:36.070
As you can see here.

07:36.460 --> 07:39.500
So this is really useful.

07:39.510 --> 07:46.080
Another thing it does is it gives you a Rand int which is a random integer and we can give it the first

07:46.080 --> 07:49.330
parameter where it should start and where it should end.

07:49.380 --> 07:55.430
If I run this look at that I get 4 than 1 then 6 and 2 just a random integer.

07:55.440 --> 08:04.010
Every time between the start and the finish another useful one with random is something called choice.

08:04.070 --> 08:12.200
And here inside of the choice we give it let's say a choice to make for example a list.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.010
One two three four.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.060
Or you know what let's do four or five.

08:17.390 --> 08:28.520
If I click Run It just makes the choice picks one from the iterator list that we have which is really

08:28.520 --> 08:31.160
rather nice just random choices.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.780
So why is this useful.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.230
Well maybe you want to build.

08:34.310 --> 08:40.940
I don't know a roulette game or a game where you need a random generator between let's say number one

08:40.940 --> 08:41.590
to 10.

08:42.080 --> 08:47.460
So this is a nice way to just do that without coding it yourself.

08:47.480 --> 08:51.950
Another one that I like is called shuffle and shuffle.

08:52.130 --> 08:57.750
If I click run here I'm probably using it the wrong way.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.870
So how can I find out more about this.

09:01.300 --> 09:08.990
Well this idea allows us to actually select and do view quick documentation which you can see as f 1.

09:09.070 --> 09:14.810
In my case it might be different based on your machine so I can just say f 1 and look at that.

09:15.580 --> 09:19.840
Well I see that shuffle has the sequence X in place.

09:19.840 --> 09:26.040
That is a modifies whatever list we're giving it in place so it returns None.

09:26.050 --> 09:32.190
So what we need to do is let's say my list that will be 1 2 THREE.

09:32.470 --> 09:34.020
Let's add a few more.

09:34.210 --> 09:36.170
Give my list in here.

09:37.830 --> 09:44.850
And instead of printing that after we'd shuffle things we'll say my list and then just print this.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.140
If I click Run now.

09:49.250 --> 09:49.760
There you go.

09:49.760 --> 09:53.390
I've shuffled my list in place.

09:53.390 --> 09:55.550
Very very cool.

09:55.550 --> 09:59.810
Now another import thing that I haven't shown yet.

09:59.900 --> 10:05.140
And you don't see it as often is to actually do something like this.

10:05.150 --> 10:08.920
I can say from random import.

10:09.140 --> 10:19.950
Shuffle or I can actually do an alias so I can say import random as and then give it an alias that is

10:20.190 --> 10:21.720
whatever we want to call it in this file.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.370
So let's say you la la.

10:24.150 --> 10:26.810
So in that case random becomes Who.

10:26.820 --> 10:27.310
La la.

10:27.660 --> 10:30.810
So you can actually avoid name collisions if you want.

10:31.170 --> 10:33.720
So if I click Run this should still work.

10:35.010 --> 10:40.590
But again a good practice for me personally is to always import only what you need.

10:40.590 --> 10:46.030
In our case we want to import from random just the shuffle.

10:46.110 --> 10:50.440
So I'm going to say shuffle because I'm being explicit here.

10:50.460 --> 10:56.340
And when a developer comes and sees that I'm importing shuffle from random they know that I'm only using

10:56.700 --> 11:04.920
this function from the random file and there's no guessing involved just like this let's learn some

11:04.980 --> 11:07.960
other built in modules in the next video.
