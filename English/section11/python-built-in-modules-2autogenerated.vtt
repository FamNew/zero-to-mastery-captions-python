00:00.480 --> 00:01.460
Welcome back.

00:01.470 --> 00:04.110
I wanted to show you one other package.

00:04.110 --> 00:10.440
Mind you we have a video coming up on useful belt in packages and python and we'll go over some of my

00:10.450 --> 00:15.580
favorites but I want to show you one that's a little bit different than what we've seen which is random.

00:15.870 --> 00:23.060
And this one is called sis for system now import sis.

00:23.120 --> 00:36.060
If I do something like let's say print sis and I click Run I get a module sis built in and so this is

00:36.060 --> 00:43.400
a really really useful one that you're going to see a lot of now with Sis.

00:43.420 --> 00:45.650
You can do something really interesting.

00:45.850 --> 00:56.120
For example sis has something called a RG The and AIG V gives you some interesting powers you see up

00:56.120 --> 01:04.760
until this point we've just kind of ran our code inside our idea but what if we had a terminal here

01:05.890 --> 01:07.340
on our desktop.

01:07.690 --> 01:12.930
And by the way see over here that we have the V and V again something that will cover so don't worry.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.300
Now in here I have a one dot pi file which is completely empty.

01:20.350 --> 01:24.090
It doesn't do anything so let's just open that up.

01:24.100 --> 01:29.800
I'm going to open it up with sublime text just because it'll be easy and in here I'll just say print

01:31.280 --> 01:32.730
Hi.

01:32.840 --> 01:36.200
So this is a python file that lives on my desktop.

01:36.380 --> 01:47.790
So I'm going to save that and imagined here that I did Python 3 and then do one dot pi if I ran this

01:48.210 --> 01:57.890
I get high from my terminal because this files on desktop and I ran the Python interpreter on this but

01:57.890 --> 02:05.210
what if I wanted to do something interesting what if I wanted to give parameters to this file perhaps

02:05.240 --> 02:15.200
say that my name is Andre well with SIS dot A.R. GV we can actually access those and I can give it as

02:15.200 --> 02:18.560
many parameters as I want.

02:18.560 --> 02:21.480
So let's give it another one like this.

02:21.570 --> 02:32.210
Let's go back to wound up by once again open up with supply and in here I'm going to import Sis Sis

02:32.500 --> 02:40.280
are GV and I can access these parameters like this by an index.

02:40.280 --> 02:44.900
So zero index will be Andre and one index will be negative.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.270
So let's try that.

02:46.280 --> 03:01.200
I'm going to say first equals sis dot RG v zero and then last will be cis dot RG V one so that now I

03:01.200 --> 03:04.500
can do an F string and say hi first

03:11.560 --> 03:18.140
just like that so if I say this and now go back to here and ran my file like this.

03:20.050 --> 03:20.640
All right.

03:20.780 --> 03:21.670
I get high.

03:21.710 --> 03:22.800
One dot pie.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.370
Andre and I made a little bit of a mistake here.

03:26.420 --> 03:30.580
It looks like the first index is actually the file name.

03:31.100 --> 03:33.130
And then you get the optional names.

03:33.350 --> 03:35.090
So it's an easy fix right.

03:35.090 --> 03:44.210
All we have to do is say 1 and 2 if I save that and click Run look at that I get high.

03:44.240 --> 03:51.870
Andre Natalie now using this knowledge that we've gathered so far.

03:52.000 --> 04:00.760
I want you to use the built in module this sis and the RG V to build a game I want to game where I can

04:00.760 --> 04:08.110
run it like this from the terminal or the command prompt where it's going to ask me for an input and

04:08.110 --> 04:15.540
say hey guess a number between one and 10 and it's going to let me keep guessing until I get that number

04:15.750 --> 04:16.910
right.

04:16.920 --> 04:22.120
So you might want to use I don't know the random module that we've learned so we'll take a break try

04:22.140 --> 04:22.940
to create that.

04:22.950 --> 04:32.370
Now this game beyond just asking for a user's input and giving you a guess 1 to 10 can also be customized

04:33.710 --> 04:42.500
so that instead of just let's say running the file I can also do something like Python 3 run the file

04:42.870 --> 04:49.990
let's say that this test file is going to be called random game dot PI that we're going to write and

04:50.180 --> 04:56.540
in here I can give it options of let's say one and one hundred.

04:56.540 --> 05:05.280
And this program is going to take using System args GP the number from start to end.

05:05.280 --> 05:09.750
So this game is gonna be really difficult because we're going to try and guess a number one to one hundred

05:10.080 --> 05:16.060
or one to let's say to which makes the game really simple.

05:16.180 --> 05:19.600
So again the goal is for you to write a program.

05:19.600 --> 05:30.160
Call it random gained pi ask a user to guess a number let's say between 1 and 10 get that information

05:30.310 --> 05:38.110
try to randomly generate a number want to 10 the user is going to be asked when I can get prompted hey

05:39.320 --> 05:46.040
I want you to guess a number want to 10 and from there we're going to keep guessing keep guessing keep

05:46.040 --> 05:52.550
guessing until I get a right and hopefully at the end say you're a genius or if I keep getting it wrong

05:52.790 --> 05:57.950
well it's going to keep asking me until I get it right and maybe do a couple of validation as well to

05:57.950 --> 06:04.590
make sure that the user actually enters what we want good luck and I'll see you in the answer video.
